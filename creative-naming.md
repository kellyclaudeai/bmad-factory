# CREATIVE PRODUCT NAMING

**Concept:** Warranty claim concierge service - we file warranty claims on behalf of consumers

**Problem:** People lose money from missed warranty claims because filing is tedious/confusing

**Target Customer:** Homeowners and consumers (25-55) who make significant purchases with warranties

**Platform:** Web app | **Business Model:** B2C

---

## Naming Approach

Vary styles to explore different positioning angles. Avoid all compound words.

---

## PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION

**ClaimDone**
*(Action-oriented)*

**Rationale:** 
- Immediately communicates the core benefit: your claim gets done
- Action verb creates urgency and completion
- Simple, memorable, two syllables
- Domain likely available (.com, .app)
- Positions service as outcome-focused (not tracking, DONE)
- Speaks to exhaustion of DIY ("I just want this done")

---

## ALTERNATIVES

### 1. **WarrantyButler**
*(Metaphorical - concierge/service)*

**Why this works:**
- Butler = personal service, handles things for you
- Clear positioning: warranty management with white-glove service
- Evokes trust, professionalism, attention to detail
- Memorable character/mascot potential
- Premium feel justifies $10/mo pricing

---

### 2. **Claimly**
*(Made-up word - friendly/casual)*

**Why this works:**
- Playful suffix (-ly) makes warranty claims feel approachable
- Short, pronounceable, memorable
- Lowercase branding potential (claimly) - modern, friendly
- Removes intimidation from claim filing
- Similar to: Grammarly, Calendly (productivity tools)

---

### 3. **Proof**
*(Single evocative word - outcome-focused)*

**Why this works:**
- Double meaning: proof of purchase + proof it works (successful claims)
- Minimalist, confident, strong
- One syllable = extremely memorable
- Implies certainty, validation, trust
- Domain may be expensive but powerful branding

---

### 4. **HandleIt**
*(Descriptive phrase - reassuring)*

**Why this works:**
- Direct promise: we handle it (the claim process)
- Conversational, approachable
- Emotional positioning: relief from hassle
- Similar to: TaskRabbit, Thumbtack (concierge services)
- Action-oriented, customer-centric

---

## FINAL SELECTION RATIONALE

**PRIMARY: ClaimDone**

- **Clarity:** Immediately obvious what the service does (claims, done)
- **Differentiation:** Competitors track; we GET IT DONE
- **Memorability:** Short, punchy, action verb
- **Emotional resonance:** Speaks to desire for completion, relief
- **SEO-friendly:** "claim done" matches search intent ("warranty claim help")
- **Domain availability:** Likely available for registration
- **Brandability:** Strong verb creates tagline opportunities ("Your Claim, Done." / "Don't File. We Do.")

**Backup: WarrantyButler** (if ClaimDone domain unavailable or feedback prefers concierge positioning)

---

## Naming Styles Used

✅ Action-oriented (ClaimDone, HandleIt)
✅ Metaphorical (WarrantyButler)
✅ Made-up word (Claimly)
✅ Single evocative word (Proof)

**Avoided:** Compound words (WarrantyHelper, ClaimTracker), descriptive phrases that are too long

**Recommendation:** **ClaimDone** as primary name for final intake.
