# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## 🔍 Web Search — DEFAULT TOOL

**ALWAYS use web-search skill instead of web_search tool:**

```bash
/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/web-search/bin/search "your query"
```

**Why:** 
- ✅ SearXNG local Docker (localhost:8888) — NO rate limits
- ✅ No API costs (Brave API is super limited)
- ✅ Built specifically for high-volume research
- ✅ Aggregates Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo results

**Status:** `docker ps | grep searxng` confirms running

**Do NOT use:** `web_search` tool (Brave API) — limited rate, causes billing errors

## 🌐 Web Browser Automation

**For logged-in browser work, use web-browser skill:**

Skill location: `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/web-browser/`

**When to use:**
- ✅ Firebase/GCP/Vercel/GitHub dashboards (logged-in)
- ✅ Web app testing (QA flows, form submissions)
- ✅ SaaS admin panels requiring authentication
- ✅ Any task requiring "do X in the browser"

**Key features:**
- **ZERO clicks required** — fully automated via Playwright CDP
- **Persistent Chrome profile** at `~/.openclaw/browser/openclaw/user-data`
  - All cookies/sessions preserved across runs
  - Stay logged in to Firebase, GCP, Vercel, etc.
- **Full automation:** Navigate, click, fill forms, screenshot, PDF

**Usage pattern:**
```bash
# Browser auto-launches when needed
# Read skill for browser tool API + examples
read /Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/web-browser/SKILL.md
```

**Assumption for factory projects:** All projects are web apps unless specified otherwise → web-browser skill available for QA/testing.

## 🔥 Firebase/Backend Setup

**For Firebase projects, use firebase-cli skill:**

Skill location: `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/firebase-cli/`

**When to use:**
- ✅ Creating new Firebase projects
- ✅ Setting up Authentication, Firestore, Hosting
- ✅ Enabling Google Cloud APIs programmatically
- ✅ Deploying Firebase Functions, Hosting sites
- ✅ Fetching Firebase SDK config (firebaseConfig.json)

**Key features:**
- **CLI-first:** Automate Firebase + GCP project creation
- **Complete backend provisioning:** Auth, Firestore, Hosting, Functions via CLI
- **SDK config generation:** Get firebaseConfig automatically

**Usage pattern:**
```bash
# Read skill for Firebase CLI commands + automation patterns
read /Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/firebase-cli/SKILL.md
```

**For web projects:** Firebase is the default backend (Auth + Firestore + Hosting).

## 🛠️ Skill Creation Standards

When creating any skill, the `description` field is the primary trigger — it's what determines when the skill gets loaded. Make it count.

**Required description format:**
1. **What it does** — one clear sentence
2. **When to use it** — specific triggers ("Use when implementing X", "Use when building Y")
3. **What it covers** — key topics/patterns/scenarios included
4. **What it does NOT cover** — scope boundaries if non-obvious

**Good example:**
```
description: Standard authentication UX and implementation patterns for all factory web apps.
Use whenever implementing signup, login, password reset, or account recovery — regardless of
auth provider. Defines: required providers, password hints, error messages for every failure
scenario, account linking rules, recovery flow, and transactional email copy.
Provider-agnostic — read alongside the provider skill which handles the actual wiring.
```

**Bad example:**
```
description: Auth skill for web apps.
```

Apply this standard every time a skill is created or updated.

## 🔒 Skill Security — MANDATORY Before Any ClaWHub Install

**Never `clawhub install` without auditing first.** ClaWHub has had confirmed malicious skill incidents (341 bad actors, Feb 2026).

Required flow (see `skill-security-audit` skill for full checklist):
1. `clawhub inspect <slug>` — check owner, age, update history
2. `clawhub inspect <slug> --files` — preview SKILL.md content
3. Scan against checklist: no external API routing, no exfiltration, no obfuscated code
4. Only install if SAFE or LOW risk

**Instant reject signals:**
- Third-party API key required (e.g., "Maton API key" in a Stripe skill)
- Instructions to POST data to external URLs
- base64/obfuscated payloads in any script
- Skill published <24h ago with no changelog

Skills installed to: `~/clawd/skills/`

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
