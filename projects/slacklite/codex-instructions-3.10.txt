Implement Story 3.10: Workspace Invite System

Story File: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/story-3.10.md

Read the story file completely and implement ALL acceptance criteria:

1. Generate invite link: /invite/{workspaceId}/{token} (token = unique random string)
2. Store invites in Firestore /workspaceInvites/{inviteId}:
   - inviteId: auto-generated
   - workspaceId: target workspace
   - token: unique random string
   - createdBy: current user UID
   - expiresAt: 7 days from now
3. Create invite link page: /invite/[workspaceId]/[token]/page.tsx
   - Show workspace name: "You have been invited to join {workspaceName}"
   - CTAs: "Sign Up" (if not authenticated) or "Join Workspace" (if authenticated)
4. Join flow: Update user document workspaceId = invited workspace ID
5. Redirect to /app after joining

Follow architecture.md patterns for Firebase usage, TypeScript types, and security rules.
Mark acceptance criteria complete in the story file as you finish each one.

Dependencies satisfied: Story 3.9 (Invite Team Modal UI) is done.
