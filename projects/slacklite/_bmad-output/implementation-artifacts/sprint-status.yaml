    completed_at: "2026-02-19T11:06:00-06:00"
    notes: |
      ✅ Created lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx with full Firebase Auth integration

      ✅ Fetches user data from Firestore /users/{uid} and merges with Firebase Auth user
      ✅ Error handling: Firestore fetch failures fall back to Firebase Auth user only
      ✅ useAuth() custom hook for consuming auth state
      ✅ Loading state management: true during initial auth check, false after resolved
      ✅ AuthProvider wraps app in app/layout.tsx
      ✅ Protected route logic: unauthenticated users redirected to /signin when accessing /app/*
      ✅ All acceptance criteria completed
      ✅ Lint and TypeScript checks passed

      ✅ Updated AuthContext with signOut method:
         - Calls Firebase signOut()

         - Handles errors gracefully with loading state
         - Cleans up Firebase listeners (authListenerCleanupRef)
         - Clears local storage and session storage
      ✅ Created Header component with destructive sign-out button
      ✅ Confirmation modal with H3 title, Cancel/Sign Out buttons
      ✅ Created app header layout (app/app/layout.tsx)
      ✅ Created app landing page (app/app/page.tsx)
      ✅ Updated Modal component to support H3 titles
      ✅ All acceptance criteria marked complete in story file

    notes: |
      ✅ Workspace creation page implemented at /create-workspace
      ✅ Form with workspace name input (1-50 chars validation)
      ✅ Creates workspace document in /workspaces/{workspaceId}
      ✅ Updates user document with workspaceId
      ✅ Creates default #general channel
      ✅ Redirects to /app on success
      ✅ Only shown once (redirects if user already has workspace)
      ✅ Loading states and error handling implemented
      ✅ Centered card layout (480px max-width) with H3 title
      ✅ All acceptance criteria completed

    notes: |
      ✅ Protected route middleware implemented
      ✅ Created middleware.ts in project root protecting /app/* routes
      ✅ Created lib/firebase-admin.ts with Firebase Admin SDK setup
      ✅ Token verification using verifyIdToken from Firebase Admin SDK
      ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users to /signin
      ✅ Attaches x-user-id header for authenticated requests
      ✅ Updated .env.example with Firebase Admin SDK credentials
      ✅ Added runtime='nodejs' for Next.js 15 compatibility
      ✅ All acceptance criteria completed
      ✅ ESLint passed (1 warning: unused error variable in catch block)
      
      Commit: 192f659 (feat(2.8): Implement protected route middleware)
      
      Note: Build fails due to existing Firebase client env issue (auth/invalid-api-key during prerender).
      This is unrelated to middleware implementation.

    notes: |
      ✅ Firebase Presence System implemented with all acceptance criteria met
      ✅ Created lib/types/presence.ts with TypeScript interfaces:
         - PresenceData, PresenceMap, PresenceConnectionState
         - UsePresenceResult, UsePresenceUpdatesResult
      ✅ Implemented lib/hooks/usePresence.ts with three hooks:
         - usePresence(): Tracks current user presence
         - usePresenceUpdates(): Subscribes to other users' presence
         - useConnectionState(): Monitors Firebase RTDB connection
      ✅ Created components/providers/PresenceProvider.tsx (lightweight provider)
      ✅ Integrated PresenceProvider into app/layout.tsx under AuthProvider
      ✅ Presence tracking features:
         - Subscribes to ref(rtdb, '.info/connected')
         - Writes /presence/{userId} with online:true + serverTimestamp()
         - Sets onDisconnect() handler for automatic offline detection
         - Syncs to Firestore /users/{userId} (isOnline, lastSeenAt fields)
         - Connection state monitoring with error handling
      ✅ ESLint validation passed
      ✅ All acceptance criteria marked complete in story file
      
      Note: Implementation was bundled with story 2.8 (commit 192f659)

      ✅ Last seen timestamp implementation complete:
      - Updated usePresence hook to write lastSeenAt on all presence changes
      - Added lastSeenAt to RTDB presence payload (online/offline transitions)
      - Created MemberList component with "Last seen X ago" tooltips using date-fns
      - Handles missing lastSeenAt with "Last seen: Never" fallback
      - Integrated with Sidebar component for member list display
      - Firestore User model updated to support optional lastSeenAt field
