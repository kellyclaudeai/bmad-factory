        "problem": "Personal budgeting app users struggle with line-item categorization when scanning receipts from multi-category purchases (e.g., Costco trip with groceries, household items, electronics). Business expense apps like Expensify and Dext support line-item extraction but cost $20-50/month and target corporate users. Consumer budgeting apps like YNAB, Copilot, and Monarch require manual entry or only capture receipt totals, making it impossible to accurately track spending by category from a single receipt. This forces users to either manually split transactions (time-consuming) or accept inaccurate category budgets, often leading them to abandon budgeting altogether.",
        "solution": "Budget from your shopping list, not your receipts. Users build shopping lists in the app BEFORE they shop, tagging items with categories as they add them. At checkout, they photograph the receipt, and the system matches line items to pre-categorized shopping list entries using fuzzy matching. Unmatched items get flagged for one-tap categorization, building a personal item library over time.",
        "targetAudience": "Budget-conscious consumers, young professionals (25-45), families tracking household spending at multi-category retailers (Costco, Target, Walmart). Currently use YNAB/Copilot/Monarch or spreadsheets. Weekly pain (every shopping trip). Proven willingness to pay $10-15/mo for budgeting apps.",

        "problem": "Consumers have no effective way to organize and track warranties, receipts, and service documents across their household purchases. Critical purchase documents arrive scattered across multiple channels (email receipts, WhatsApp photos from family members, physical receipts, warranty PDFs) and never consolidate into one searchable place. This leads to missed warranty claims, lost money on expired extended warranties/service contracts, and inability to provide proof of purchase when needed for repairs or returns.",
        "solution": "Warranty claim concierge service. Users upload receipts (AI-assisted), ClaimDone tracks warranties and sends expiry reminders. When product breaks, user submits claim via app. ClaimDone concierge team contacts manufacturer on user's behalf, handles entire claim process (forms, proof of purchase, follow-ups), and resolves claim. $10/mo subscription for unlimited claim filings. Competes on outcome (successful claims) not features (tracking).",
        "targetAudience": "Homeowners and consumers (25-55) who make significant purchases with warranties - appliances, electronics, furniture, tools. Episodic but high-stakes pain (when repair needed, warranty expires unused). Currently use scattered workarounds (cloud photos, spreadsheets, email search) or DIY tracker apps (Warranty Keeper, SlipCrate). Proven willingness to pay (documented financial losses $100s-$1000s from missed claims).",

Core pain: FOMO (finding out about great local events after they've happened), disconnection from local community, information scattered across Instagram/Facebook groups/local websites.",
        "solution": "Radar-style map interface showing ONLY events happening in the next 4 hours within configurable radius (0.5-2 miles). No calendars, no planning—pure spontaneity. Push notifications fire at optimal decision moments (e.g., 'Taco popup starting in 30 mins, 0.3mi away'). Users subscribe to event types (food, music, art) and get real-time pings when interests activate nearby. Anti-calendar design—deliberately ephemeral. Events disappear from radar as they end, creating urgency. Novel approach: Radar metaphor for ephemeral local events (never been done), NOW-only view eliminates decision paralysis, visual pulse rings show real-time activity.",
        "targetAudience": "Urban dwellers (20-40), socially curious, want to explore their neighborhood, interested in food/music/arts/culture.
