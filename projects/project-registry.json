        "problem": "Personal budgeting app users struggle with line-item categorization when scanning receipts from multi-category purchases (e.g., Costco trip with groceries, household items, electronics). Business expense apps like Expensify and Dext support line-item extraction but cost $20-50/month and target corporate users. Consumer budgeting apps like YNAB, Copilot, and Monarch require manual entry or only capture receipt totals, making it impossible to accurately track spending by category from a single receipt. This forces users to either manually split transactions (time-consuming) or accept inaccurate category budgets, often leading them to abandon budgeting altogether.",
