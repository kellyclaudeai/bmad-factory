# Creative Naming - Retrograde (Shopping List First)

## Concept
Budget from your shopping list, not your receipts. Users build shopping lists in the app BEFORE they shop, tagging items with categories as they add them. At checkout, they photograph the receipt, and the system matches line items to pre-categorized shopping list entries using fuzzy matching.

## Target Customer
Budget-conscious consumers, young professionals (25-45), families tracking household spending

## Platform
Web-app, B2C

## PRIMARY NAME: **Prepwise**

**Style:** Compound Word (Prep + Wise)

**Rationale:**
- **"Prep"** = preparation, planning (shopping list phase)
- **"Wise"** = smart, informed decisions (budget-conscious)
- Captures the core value prop: be wise by prepping
- Easy to remember, pronounce, spell
- Domain: prepwise.com (likely available)
- Brandable, professional but approachable

---

## ALTERNATIVE NAMES:

### 1. **Beforehand** 
**Style:** Single Evocative Word

**Why it works:**
- Emphasizes the "before you shop" paradigm shift
- Memorable, conversational ("I use Beforehand to plan my Costco trips")
- Simple, clean, no explanation needed
- Domain: beforehand.app or usebeforehand.com

### 2. **CartCheck**
**Style:** Compound Word (Cart + Check)

**Why it works:**
- References both phases: "cart" (shopping list) + "check" (receipt verification)
- Action-oriented, clear functionality
- Easy to explain: "Build your cart, then check your receipt"
- Domain: cartcheck.com, cartcheck.app

### 3. **Tally First**
**Style:** Action Phrase

**Why it works:**
- "Tally" = count/categorize, "First" = before shopping
- Playful inversion of traditional "buy first, tally later" flow
- Memorable tagline potential: "Tally First, Shop Smart"
- Domain: tallyfirst.com

### 4. **Sorted**
**Style:** Single Word (Outcome-Focused)

**Why it works:**
- Double meaning: "sorted" = categorized AND "sorted" = problem solved
- British slang for "figured out" ("I'm sorted") = confidence, control
- Short, punchy, modern
- Domain: sorted.app, usesorted.com (may be taken, check availability)
