# Creative Naming - Phase 6

**Research Lead Session:** agent:research-lead:5
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Concept:** Lock screen widget voice assistant for gift idea capture

---

## PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION

### **Keeper** (Metaphorical)

**Rationale:** Captures the emotional core of protecting precious gift ideas throughout the year — warm, memorable, and instantly communicates preservation of thoughtful moments without being overly literal.

**Strengths:**
- Single word, easy to remember
- Emotional resonance with "thoughtful gift givers" persona
- Implies both protection and retention
- Not overly literal (allows brand expansion beyond gifts)
- .com domain potentially available (keeper.com)
- App Store SEO: "Keeper - Gift Ideas" = memorable

**Weaknesses:**
- Generic word (domain/trademark challenges likely)
- May require "for Gifts" subtitle for clarity
- Could be confused with password managers (Keeper Security)

---

## ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS

### 1. **GiftPocket** (Compound Words)

**Rationale:** Instantly understandable value prop; combines the "what" (gifts) with the "how" (quick pocket access from lock screen); straightforward but potentially less brandable.

**Strengths:**
- Clear value proposition in name
- Communicates "quick access" metaphor
- Easy to explain to users
- Domain likely available (giftpocket.com)

**Weaknesses:**
- Less brandable (generic compound)
- Feels utilitarian vs emotional
- Competitors could use similar naming (GiftBox, GiftWallet)

---

### 2. **Notch** (Single Evocative)

**Rationale:** Short, punchy, implies marking/noting something important the moment it happens; strong verb-noun duality, though gift context isn't immediately obvious.

**Strengths:**
- One syllable, highly memorable
- Strong action association ("notch it down")
- Modern, minimalist feel
- Domain likely available (notch.app)

**Weaknesses:**
- Gift context not obvious (requires subtitle)
- Could be confused with phone screen "notch"
- May feel too abstract for mainstream users

---

### 3. **Catch** (Action-oriented)

**Rationale:** Dynamic and urgent, emphasizes capturing fleeting ideas before they disappear; simple single-syllable memorability but highly generic (domain challenges likely).

**Strengths:**
- Perfectly describes core action (catching ideas)
- One syllable, easy to say/remember
- Urgent, action-oriented feel

**Weaknesses:**
- Extremely generic (catch.com unavailable, high trademark risk)
- No gift context
- Could apply to any note-taking app

---

### 4. **Remembra** (Made-up Word)

**Rationale:** Playful portmanteau of "remember" + suffix suggesting a tool/assistant; brandable and unique, though requires user education and may feel less premium.

**Strengths:**
- Highly brandable (unique, trademarkable)
- Communicates function (remembering)
- Friendly, approachable tone
- Domain available (remembra.com)

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires user education (not immediately obvious)
- May feel less premium/serious
- Could be perceived as "cutesy"
- Spelling could be confusing (Remembra vs Remembera)

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Lead with: Keeper**

- Emotional resonance strongest
- Single word = most memorable
- Metaphorical depth allows brand evolution
- Works well with subtitle: "Keeper - Gift Ideas on Lock Screen"

**Fallback: GiftPocket**

- If domain/trademark conflicts arise with "Keeper"
- Clear value prop in name
- Easier App Store discovery (literal keywords)

**Do NOT use: Catch**

- Too generic, trademark/domain nightmare
- Dilutes gift-specific positioning

**Name:** Keeper
**Subtitle:** Lock Screen Gift Ideas
**Keywords:** gift tracker, gift ideas, thoughtful gifts, lock screen widget, voice capture, gift list, present ideas, birthday gifts
