# Creative Product Naming
**Project:** Hyper-Local Event Discovery  
**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Phase:** 6 - Creative Naming

---

## Concept Summary

**Core Idea:** Radar-style map showing ONLY events in next 4 hours within configurable radius. Push notifications at optimal moments. Anti-calendar, ephemeral, spontaneity-focused. Visual radar rings pulse to show real-time local activity.

**Problem Solved:** People missing out on local experiences (food popups, open mics, workshops) because they discover them too late via Instagram stories.

**Target Customer:** Urban dwellers (20-40), socially curious, want to explore their neighborhood, interested in food/music/arts/culture.

**Platform:** iOS native app | **Business Model:** B2C freemium

## Name Recommendations

### PRIMARY: Ripple
**Style:** Metaphorical  
**Rationale:** Events ripple outward from your location like radar waves, capturing both the visual metaphor and the feeling of spontaneous discovery spreading from where you are right now.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Directly evokes the radar UI visual (concentric ripples)
- ✅ Implies movement, discovery, spreading awareness
- ✅ Single word, memorable, easy to pronounce
- ✅ Available domain: rippleapp.com potentially available
- ✅ Emotional resonance: "making ripples in your neighborhood"

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ "Ripple" used by fintech (XRP cryptocurrency) — may cause confusion in search
- ⚠️ Common word (harder to trademark)

---

### ALTERNATIVE 1: NowNear
**Style:** Compound Words  
**Rationale:** Fuses time urgency with hyper-local proximity in a memorable, punchy two-syllable name that's immediately clear about the app's promise.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Functional clarity: "Now" (ephemeral) + "Near" (location-based)
- ✅ Two syllables, easy to say
- ✅ Descriptive without being generic
- ✅ Explains value prop instantly ("events happening now, near you")

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Less emotional/evocative than metaphorical names
- ✅ High memorability for new users ("Oh, NowNear—got it")

---

### ALTERNATIVE 2: Catch
**Style:** Action-oriented  
**Rationale:** Frames the experience as actively catching fleeting moments before they pass, emphasizes the anti-FOMO urgency and spontaneity over passive scrolling.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Single syllable, super punchy
- ✅ Verb = action-oriented (encourages active discovery)
- ✅ Implies urgency ("catch it before it's gone")
- ✅ Emotional hook: "What did you catch tonight?"
- ✅ Easy branding: "Catch events before they disappear"

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Common word (trademark challenges, SEO competition)
- ⚠️ Could be confused with "catch up" (messaging apps)
- ✅ Strong verb association = memorable

---

### ALTERNATIVE 3: Spot
**Style:** Playful/Casual  
**Rationale:** Friendly, single-syllable verb that suggests discovering hidden gems in your neighborhood; low-pressure tone matches the exploratory, curious target audience.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Single syllable, casual, approachable
- ✅ Verb: "spot events" = active discovery
- ✅ Friendly tone (not urgent/aggressive)
- ✅ Implies discovery of hidden things ("spot a gem")
- ✅ Works as noun too: "that's a great spot"

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Common word (SEO challenges)
- ⚠️ Spotify proximity (could be confusing)
- ✅ Playful vibe fits target audience (20-40, exploratory)
