Deep dive into OpenClaw source code found: 4 lanes exist (main, cron, subagent, nested). sessions_spawn hardcodes lane=AGENT_LANE_SUBAGENT. openclaw gateway call agent defaults to lane=AGENT_LANE_NESTED. Both PL and RL use sessions_spawn identically — no lane argument passed anywhere in factory code (AGENTS.md, openclaw.json, flow docs). RL parallel spawns work (Carson, Victor, Maya, Quinn all active with ~9k tokens each). PL parallel spawns fail (8-12 agents become zombies at 0 tokens). KEY FINDING: nested lane has default concurrency of 1 (never configured at startup), but this should only affect orchestrator turns, not their spawned subagents which use the subagent lane. Still no explanation for why PL subagents fail but RL subagents succeed. Possibly scale-related (RL spawns 4-5, PL spawns 8-12) or related to PL 60s heartbeat causing lane contention."
