## Skills Investigation & Reorganization

User reported missing skills from workspace, specifically mentioning:
- skill-creator
- security-audit
- "entire subdirectories missing"

**Investigation findings:**
- Local workspace `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/` only ever had factory/utilities/web
- Git history shows only `chrome-relay-driver` was deleted
- Global OpenClaw skills at `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/` still exist with 50+ skills
- User was likely thinking of global skills, not local workspace skills

**Resolution:**
1. Established local skills workspace with proper structure
2. Copied essential skills from global OpenClaw installation:
   - skill-creator, coding-agent, github, tmux, things-mac, gog
3. Created custom security-audit skill for factory projects
4. Organized into pipeline phases: build/, plan/, test/

**Final Structure:**
- **build/** - coding-agent, security-audit
- **plan/** - (future planning skills)
- **test/** - tea-smoke-test-web.sh, tea-smoke-test-ios.sh
- **factory/** - memory-system-v2, project-lead-instantiator, session-closer
- **utilities/** - skill-creator, github, gog, tmux, things-mac, web-browser, web-search
- **web/tech-stack/** - firebase-cli, oauth-automation

**Kelly Improver Enhancement:**
- Added "Available Skills" section to kelly-improver's AGENTS.md
- Gave kelly-improver access to skill-creator and other factory improvement skills
- Enables kelly-improver to prototype new skills, audit existing ones, and generate concrete proposals
- Skills: skill-creator, security-audit, coding-agent, github, memory-system-v2, web-browser

**Note:** 
- Memory search was disabled due to OpenAI embeddings quota error
- Global OpenClaw skills kept as reference/backup library
- Local workspace skills take precedence over global skills
- Kelly-improver workspace is separate from main git repo (in ~/.openclaw/workspace-kelly-improver/)
