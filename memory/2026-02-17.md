# 2026-02-17 - Daily Memory Log

## Projects Started

### daily-todo-tracker (12:26 CST)
- **Type:** Fast Mode Greenfield (Barry Fast Track)
- **Request:** Operator wants simple to-do tracking app for daily/weekly tasks
- **Tech stack:** Next.js + Tailwind + localStorage/Supabase + Vercel
- **Status:** Barry planning in progress (spawned 12:29 CST)
- **Estimated stories:** 5-8 stories
- **Session:** agent:project-lead:project-daily-todo-tracker
- **Path:** `/Users/austenallred/clawd/projects/daily-todo-tracker/`

## Bugfixes

### kelly-dashboard - Thinking Block Rendering (12:39 CST)
- **Issue:** Dashboard showing "Raw Message (unrecognized format)" for Project Lead session logs
- **Root cause:** OpenClaw now uses new message format with `content` array containing thinking/toolCall blocks
  - Old format: `{ thinking: "...", toolCalls: [...] }` (top-level properties)
  - New format: `{ content: [{ type: "thinking" }, { type: "toolCall" }] }` (array of blocks)
- **Fix:** Updated `/components/subagent-view/formatted-message.tsx`
  - Added `extractThinkingBlocks()` and `extractToolCalls()` to parse content array
  - Maintained backward compatibility with old format
  - Now renders BOTH thinking and tool calls when they appear together
- **Result:** Dashboard now properly displays 💭 thinking blocks and 🔧 tool calls

## Lessons Learned

### Dashboard Timing Issues
- kelly-dashboard polls project directories and tries to load state files immediately
- When new projects start, Barry hasn't created files yet → Next.js errors in console
- Expected behavior: Errors disappear once planning completes (1-2 minutes)
- **Potential improvement:** Add error handling to show "Planning in progress..." instead of raw errors

### Message Format Evolution
- OpenClaw message format has evolved to support thinking blocks in content array
- UIs need to handle both old and new formats during transition period
- Always check for content in both locations: top-level properties AND content array
- Thinking blocks may appear alongside tool calls in same message (render both)

## Monitoring Improvements (13:32 CST)

### Issue: fleai-market-v4 Stuck Sessions Not Detected
- **Problem:** 2 Codex sessions stuck for 60-70 min without Kelly alert
- **Root causes:**
  1. Stuck threshold too high (90 minutes)
  2. No implementation-state.md file → no granular progress visibility
  3. PL recovered autonomously without escalation (good!) but Kelly didn't know
- **Sessions affected:** Story 4.5 (Global Search), Story 4.7 (Shopping Cart)
- **Outcome:** PL detected stuck sessions, committed work, spawned next wave (autonomous recovery worked)

### Changes Made
1. **HEARTBEAT.md updated:**
   - Stuck threshold: 90 min → 60 min
   - Escalation threshold: 3 hours → 2 hours
   - Skip duration after "all good": 60 min → 45 min
   - Added requirement for implementation-state.md during implementation stage

2. **implementation-state.md requirement:**
   - Now required for all projects in implementation stage
   - Contains: current wave, active sessions (with PIDs), completed stories, dependencies
   - Update frequency: after wave completion, subagent spawn, stuck recovery
   - fleai-market-v4 PL already created it (13:25 CST) - ahead of the requirement!

3. **factory-state.md updated:**
   - Documented monitoring improvements
   - Added fleai-market-v4 compliance status

### Lessons Learned
- **Silent success can look like failure:** PL recovered autonomously (good design!) but operator couldn't see it
- **State files are the eyes:** Without implementation-state.md, Kelly only sees project-state.json timestamps
- **Tighter thresholds catch issues faster:** 60 min vs 90 min means ~30 min earlier detection
- **PL doesn't need to announce recoveries to Kelly:** As long as PL handles stuck sessions correctly and updates state files

## daily-todo-tracker Complete (13:36 CST)

### Status: READY FOR QA
- **Total time:** 1 hour 10 minutes (12:26 → 13:36 CST)
- **Stories completed:** 7/7 (1.1-1.7)
- **Track:** Barry Fast Mode Greenfield
- **QA URL:** http://localhost:3001

### What Barry Built
1. Story 1.1: Next.js project setup with TypeScript + Tailwind
2. Story 1.2: Add task functionality (title, scope: today/week/anytime)
3. Story 1.3: Complete/incomplete toggle
4. Story 1.4: Delete tasks
5. Story 1.5: Filter by scope (All/Today/Week/Completed)
6. Story 1.6: localStorage persistence
7. Story 1.7: UI polish + responsive design

### Recovery Note
- Story 1.7 session closed prematurely but work was complete
- Project Lead detected, committed all files, verified build
- Same pattern as fleai-market-v4 Codex sessions (work completes, session dies before final commit)

### Validation
- Barry Fast Mode workflow: ✅ Works as designed
- Planning → Implementation → QA handoff: ✅ Smooth
- Estimated 5-8 stories, actual 7 stories: ✅ Accurate
- Total time ~1 hour: ✅ Fast Mode lived up to name

## fleai-market-v4 Status Check (13:24 CST)

### Operator Request
"fleai project seems stuck, can you check in with that PL and see why it's subagents/the PL didn't report the stuckness"

### Findings
- **Issue:** 2 Codex sessions (story 4.5, 4.7) stuck for 60-70 min without Kelly alert
- **Reality:** Sessions completed work but died before commit (known Codex pattern)
- **PL response:** Already recovered autonomously - committed work, spawned next batch
- **Current status:** 35/68 stories (51%), Wave 6 active (4 stories)

### Why No Alert
1. Stuck threshold too high (90 minutes) - sessions stuck for 60-70 min (below threshold)
2. No implementation-state.md file - Kelly couldn't see granular progress
3. PL recovered autonomously without escalation (good design!)

### Actions Taken
See "Monitoring Improvements (13:32 CST)" section above.

## Research Lead Search Tool Fix (19:39 CST)

### Issue
Research Lead and Mary were using Brave Search API (`web_search` tool) which has rate limits and caused API billing errors in earlier sessions.

### Solution Applied
Updated Research Lead + Mary AGENTS.md to use **web-search skill** instead:
- **Tool:** `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/web-search/bin/search "query"`
- **Backend:** SearXNG local Docker (localhost:8888)
- **Benefits:** No rate limits, no API costs, built specifically for high-volume research

### Files Updated (19:39-19:42 CST)

**AGENTS.md (spawning instructions):**
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-bmm-mary/AGENTS.md`
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-research-lead/AGENTS.md`

**TOOLS.md (default tool guidance for ALL agents):**
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/TOOLS.md` — Main workspace (all agents inherit)
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-research-lead/TOOLS.md`
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-project-lead/TOOLS.md`
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-bmm-mary/TOOLS.md`
- All 9 BMAD agent workspaces (John, Sally, Winston, Bob, Barry, Carson, Victor, Maya, Quinn)
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-main/TOOLS.md` (Kelly main workspace)

**Total:** 14 TOOLS.md files updated with web-search default section

## Web Browser Skill Added to TOOLS.md (19:46 CST)

### Why
Operator asked: "We have these web skills, where should those go on the tools.md? Let's just assume every app is web for now."

### Changes Applied
Added **web-browser skill** documentation to TOOLS.md (main + agent workspaces):

**Main workspace:** `/Users/austenallred/clawd/TOOLS.md`
- Documents web-browser skill for logged-in automation
- Assumption: All factory projects are web apps → web-browser available for QA

**Agent workspaces updated:**
- Project Lead — needs web-browser for QA phase (verify deployed apps)
- Amelia — needs web-browser for testing implementations
- Barry — needs web-browser for fast-track QA

### Web-Browser Skill Overview
- **Backend:** Playwright CDP → persistent Chrome profile
- **Zero clicks:** Fully automated (navigate, click, fill forms, screenshot)
- **Persistent sessions:** Stay logged into Firebase/GCP/Vercel/GitHub
- **Use cases:** Web app QA, dashboard automation, logged-in workflows

**Commit:** `2fca09c` — "docs(tools): add web-browser skill to TOOLS.md"

### Impact
- Current 20-session batch (started 19:31 CST) still using old tool (started before change)
- Future Research Lead sessions will use web-search skill (no billing issues)
- SearXNG confirmed running: `searxng/searxng:latest` on port 8888

## Research Lead Batch Generation - 20 Parallel Sessions (19:31 CST)

### Launch Details
- **Sessions:** `agent:research-lead:3` through `agent:research-lead:22` (20 total)
- **Launch time:** 2026-02-17 19:31 CST
- **Method:** `openclaw gateway call agent` with explicit sessionKey + idempotencyKey
- **Expected completion:** ~20:10-20:20 CST (40-50 min per session)
- **Constraints:** B2C businessModel, web-app platform, avoid B2B/enterprise/agency-tools (via `research-config.json`)

### Purpose
- Test Research Lead at scale (20 autonomous product idea generations running in parallel)
- Generate 20 unique B2C web-app product briefs for operator to review
- Validate registry coordination (prevents duplicate pain point research)

### Expected Output
- 20 product briefs in `projects-queue/<name>-<timestamp>/intake.md`
- Each brief: problem, solution, market size, business model, tech stack, MVP stories
- Operator can select which ideas to route to Project Lead for implementation

### Registry Coordination
- Each RL session checks `research-registry.json` before researching a pain point
- Prevents duplicate pain point research across parallel sessions
- 3 checkpoints: Phase 2 (initial), Phase 4 (after selection), Phase 6 (final)

### Previous Research Lead Outputs
1. **ClientSignal** (session #1) — B2B customer intelligence platform (not B2C focus)
2. **TakeoutTrap** (session #2) — B2C browser extension for DoorDash takeout intervention (27 min runtime)

## fleai-market-v5 Implementation Progress (18:00-19:25 CST)

### Status
- **Progress:** 41/48 stories complete (85%)
- **Remaining:** 7 stories
- **Mode:** Dependency-driven spawning confirmed working
- **Deferred:** Story 4.8 (Email Notifications) — leaf node, Codex analysis paralysis

### Planning Phase Complete (18:11 CST)
All 8 Normal Greenfield BMAD planning steps completed:
1. ✅ John (PRD) — 6m39s
2. ✅ Sally (UX) — 9m39s
3. ✅ Winston (Architecture) — 10m55s
4. ✅ John (Epics) — 6m14s
5. ✅ John (Gate Check) — 2m49s
6. ✅ Bob (Sprint Planning) — 5m12s
7. ✅ Bob (Dependency Graph) — 3m28s
8. ✅ Bob (Create Stories) — 7m34s

**Total planning time:** ~52 minutes (17:31-18:23 CST)

### Implementation Phase Active (18:23-19:25 CST)
- **Duration:** ~62 minutes so far
- **Stories completed:** 41/48 (85%)
- **Active sessions:** Multiple Amelia sessions processing remaining stories
- **Execution model:** Dependency-driven spawning (stories spawn as `dependsOn` satisfied)
- **Confirmation:** Stories from multiple epics completing in parallel (not artificial waves)

### Story 4.8 Skip Decision (19:20 CST)
- **Story:** Email Notifications (5 functions + 4 templates + retry logic + tests)
- **Issue:** Codex spent 19 min analyzing Supabase email API in infinite loop without creating files
- **Decision:** Skip/defer to post-MVP (leaf node, nothing depends on it)
- **Lesson:** Codex can hit analysis paralysis on complex tasks; Claude Code fallback works better

### Bob's Dependency Graph Metadata
- **File:** `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/dependency-graph.json`
- **Extra fields:** Bob added helpful metadata: `parallelGroup`, `parallelizationAnalysis`, `recommendations`
- **PL behavior:** Project Lead correctly ignores parallelGroup, uses individual `dependsOn` arrays only
- **Outcome:** Dependency-driven spawning working as intended (not wave-based)
- **Clarification:** Bob's extra metadata is harmless — PL uses authority fields correctly

### Model Lineup Reminder
- **Opus 4.6:** John (PM) + Winston (Architect) only (deep reasoning tasks)
- **Sonnet 4.5:** Bob, Sally, Barry, Mary, Amelia wrapper, Murat, CIS agents
- **CLI models:** gpt-5.3-codex (default), gpt-5.3-spark (Barry fast track), Sonnet 4.5 (Claude Code fallback)

## Research Lead #2 Complete - TakeoutTrap (19:15 CST)

### Output
- **Product:** TakeoutTrap — B2C browser extension for DoorDash takeout intervention
- **Description:** Smart intervention system that catches users ordering takeout and suggests healthier/cheaper alternatives (meal kits, local pickup, home cooking)
- **Location:** `projects-queue/takeouttrap-2026-02-17-1915/intake.md`
- **Session:** `agent:research-lead:2` (created via `gateway call agent`)
- **Runtime:** ~27 minutes

### Success
- ✅ B2C focus (not B2B like ClientSignal)
- ✅ Web-app platform (browser extension)
- ✅ Full product brief generated (problem, solution, market, tech stack, MVP stories)
- ✅ Registry coordination working (TakeoutTrap filed, no duplicates)

## Gateway Configuration Update (10:17 CST)

### Change Applied
- **Action:** config.patch to add explicit 'main' agent definition
- **Purpose:** Ensure Kelly Router (main agent) gets 5-minute heartbeat polls
- **Context:** Matrix DMs should use main agent by default
- **Doctor hint:** `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` (not run yet)
- **Status:** ✅ Gateway restarted successfully

## Heartbeat Monitoring Activity (10:17-14:18 CST)

### Pattern Observed
- Kelly receives heartbeat polls every ~5 minutes as configured
- Checks fleai-market-v4 implementation-state.md timestamp (last: 13:26 CST)
- Updates heartbeat-state.json with lastProjectCheck timestamps
- All projects showing normal operation:
  - fleai-market-v4: "status: ok, stage: implementation"
  - calculator-app, kelly-dashboard, daily-todo-tracker: surfaced for QA

### QA Surfacing Success
- **13:38 CST:** daily-todo-tracker moved to userQA stage
- **13:40 CST:** Kelly detected and surfaced: "🧪 **daily-todo-tracker** ready for user QA: http://localhost:3011"
- **Storage:** Added to heartbeat-state.json surfacedQA list
- **Result:** Operator notified successfully

## Dependency-Driven Spawning Migration (14:30-15:30 CST)

### Problem
Project Lead was using artificial batch/wave parallelization (spawn N stories, wait for ALL to complete, spawn next batch). This caused cascading stalls when any single story in a wave failed or hung.

### Root Cause
PL AGENTS.md had conflicting instructions across 6 locations — some said "waves", some said "dependency-driven". PL followed the wave approach.

### Fix Applied
- **Updated PL AGENTS.md** (`/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-project-lead/AGENTS.md`): Removed ALL 6 batch/wave references
- **New behavior:** Spawn stories immediately as their `dependsOn` arrays are satisfied (from Bob's `stories-parallelization.json`)
- **Both Fast Mode and Normal BMAD** use same dependency-driven strategy
- Old PL session died; fresh PL instantiated via `project-lead-instantiator` skill

### Key Decision
Bob's `stories-parallelization.json` is the single authority for story dependencies. Each story has individual `dependsOn` arrays. PL must use these directly — no artificial grouping.

## fleai-market-v4 Progress Audit (15:00 CST)

### Accurate Story Count
- **37/68 complete (54%)** — up from earlier estimates
- **Completed:** 1.1-1.8, 2.1-2.8, 3.1-3.7, 4.1-4.7, 5.1, 5.2, 8.1, 8.2, 8.6, 8.7, 9.1
- **Active (uncertain):** 2.9-v2 (PID 96278), 4.8-v2 (PID 96279) — may be dead Codex sessions
- **Remaining:** 31 stories

### Codex Death Pattern (3 occurrences)
1. **Wave 4 (06:09):** All 6 PIDs (10256-10261) died immediately after spawn
2. **Wave 5 (10:28):** 2/3 PIDs (68304/68305) died after completing work; 1 (68306) hung at 0% CPU
3. **Wave 6 (14:24):** 2/4 PIDs (90927/90928) died at 70 min with incomplete work; 2 (90926/90929) completed but died before commit
- **Root cause unknown** — possibly Codex resource limits or stability issue

### PL Session State
- `agent:project-lead:fleai-market-v4`: 184k/200k context (92%) — approaching limit
- Matrix-based PL session: 6.5h stale (was installing BMAD TEA module)
- `agent:project-lead:main`: Running, HEARTBEAT_OK

## Active Context (15:30 CST)

- **Factory projects:** 3 ready for QA (calculator-app, kelly-dashboard, daily-todo-tracker), 1 in implementation (fleai-market-v4)
- **Operator timezone:** America/Chicago (CST)
- **Kelly session:** Main session (direct chat with operator) — 3 compactions today
- **Current focus:** fleai-market-v4 implementation with dependency-driven spawning
- **fleai-market-v4 status:** 37/68 stories (54%), 2 active subagents (status uncertain), PL at 92% context
- **Key risk:** PL context exhaustion — may need fresh session soon
- **Heartbeat health:** ✅ All systems operational
- **Next:** Monitor fleai-market-v4 PL, verify dependency-driven spawning works, check if active Codex PIDs are alive

## Factory Architecture Refactor (19:00-19:59 CST)

### Problem
The `factory-architecture` skill contained 37KB of comprehensive documentation about Research Lead and Project Lead flows. This was wrong because:
1. Factory architecture is NOT a skill — it's documentation
2. Skills should be executable tools/workflows, not pure reference material
3. Duplication between skill and `docs/` created maintenance burden

### Solution: Move to docs/ as Source of Truth
- **Killed** `skills/factory/factory-architecture/` skill entirely
- **Created** canonical docs in `docs/`:
  - `factory-overview.md` (5822 bytes) — high-level hierarchy, 4 modes, git workflow, BMAD reference
  - `project-lead-flow.md` (8508 bytes) — complete PL spec: all modes × phases, dependency spawning, state mgmt
  - `research-lead-flow.md` (renamed from `research-lead-v1-detailed.md`) — canonical RL flow doc
- **Archived** 5 superseded drafts to `docs/archive/`
- **Committed** as `f04767c`: "refactor: move factory architecture from skill to docs/"

### New Rule
AGENTS.md files should reference docs/ for flow specs, not duplicate architecture documentation.

## Agent Readiness Audit (19:00-19:59 CST)

### Audit Findings
Kelly-improver performed comprehensive readiness audit across all 14 agents:
- **Normal Greenfield:** ⚠️ works but has bugs (git strategy mismatch, missing dependency-graph docs)
- **Fast Greenfield:** ⚠️ works but messy (Barry trimming needed)
- **Brownfield modes:** ⚠️ partially ready (John/Sally/Winston missing EDIT mode)
- **Research Lead:** ❌ not ready (5 agents didn't exist)

### Agent AGENTS.md Rewrites

#### Project Lead (556 → 160 lines)
- **Before:** 17.8K of duplicated flow descriptions, wave logic, conflicting instructions
- **After:** 6.4K of behavioral rules + references to `docs/project-lead-flow.md`
- **Key fix:** Removed all remaining batch/wave language (was in 6 locations)

#### Bob (33 → 97 lines)
- **Critical gap:** Bob didn't know he was responsible for creating `dependency-graph.json`
- **Added:** Full documentation of `stories-parallelization.json` format, rules, brownfield handling
- **Format:** `{ "stories": [{ "storyId": "1.1", "dependsOn": ["1.2"], "title": "..." }] }`

#### Amelia (dev branch git strategy)
- **Before:** AGENTS.md said branch-per-story, but `docs/project-lead-flow.md` + practice said `dev` branch
- **Fixed:** All work on `dev` branch, pull --rebase on conflicts, descriptive commit messages
- **Consistency:** Now matches actual practice and docs

#### John (Strategist) - Brownfield EDIT mode
- **Before:** Only CREATE workflow (create-prd)
- **After:** Added `edit-prd` workflow for brownfield
  - Read existing PRD first
  - Update sections while preserving structure
  - Continue epic numbering (e.g., if PRD has Epic 1-3, add Epic 4+)
- **Epic workflow:** CREATE-only for greenfield, ADD mode for brownfield (append to existing)

#### Sally (UX) - Brownfield EDIT mode
- **Before:** Only CREATE workflow (create-ux-design)
- **After:** Added `edit-ux-design` workflow
  - Read existing design first
  - Preserve design system/component choices
  - Update or append screens as needed

#### Winston (Architect) - Brownfield + document-project
- **Before:** Only CREATE workflow (create-architecture)
- **After:** Added 3 workflows:
  - `edit-architecture` — brownfield updates
  - `document-project` — analyze existing codebase, generate project context (was unassigned)
  - `generate-project-context` — maps to document-project
- **Confirmed:** Winston handles `document-project` (analyzes architecture, fits BMAD Architect role)

#### Barry (Fast Mode) - Trimmed from 396 → 100 lines
- **Before:** 80% was dummy project plan examples (300+ lines of Lorem Ipsum-style bloat)
- **After:** Just the instructions and workflow rules
- **Kept:** Fast Mode greenfield/brownfield workflows, audit mode

#### Mary (Business Analyst) - Dual Context
- **Before:** Only BMAD context (brainstorming, research, product brief)
- **After:** Two contexts depending on spawner:
  1. **BMAD Planning** (spawned by PL) — standard analyst workflows
  2. **Research Lead Pipeline** (spawned by RL) — Phase 1 (discovery), Phase 4 (selection), Phase 5 (deep dive)
- **Randomization mandate:** Each RL session, intentionally vary approach (industries, sources, angles)

### Research Lead + 4 CIS Agents Created

#### Research Lead (new agent)
- **Workspace:** `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-research-lead/`
- **AGENTS.md:** Full 6-phase pipeline (discovery → registry → CIS ideation → selection → deep dive → package)
- **Subagents:** mary, carson, victor, maya, quinn
- **Gateway config:** Registered in `agents.list` with `allowAgents` array
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Purpose:** Autonomous SaaS product idea generation (no human interaction)

#### Carson - Brainstorming Coach (CIS)
- **Workspace:** `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-cis-carson/`
- **AGENTS.md:** SCAMPER, divergent thinking, "yes, and..." methodology
- **Spawned by:** Research Lead during Phase 3 (CIS Ideation)
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Output:** 3-5 distinct SaaS solution concepts per pain point

#### Victor - Innovation Strategist (CIS)
- **Workspace:** `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-cis-victor/`
- **AGENTS.md:** Blue Ocean Strategy, disruption theory, market arbitrage
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Focus:** Identify untapped markets and strategic differentiation

#### Maya - Design Thinking Coach (CIS)
- **Workspace:** `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-cis-maya/`
- **AGENTS.md:** Empathy maps, "How Might We?" questions, user delight
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Focus:** Human-centered solutions

#### Quinn - Creative Problem Solver (CIS)
- **Workspace:** `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-cis-quinn/`
- **AGENTS.md:** TRIZ, systems thinking, root cause analysis
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Focus:** Solve real problem underneath surface complaints, elegant solutions

### Cleanup
- **Removed stale workspaces:** `workspace-bmm-john` (duplicate), `workspace-kelly-refactor` (unused)
- **Cleaned Amelia workspace:** Removed 11 leaked artifacts (fleai-market/, firebase-debug.log, story-*.md, etc.)

### Commit
- **SHA:** `8342cc0`
- **Message:** "major: agent audit - rewrite AGENTS.md for all modes, create RL + CIS agents"
- **Files changed:** 3 files (docs, factory-state.md, memory/2026-02-17.md)
- **Impact:** +804 insertions, -495 deletions

### Status
✅ **All 4 PL modes ready:** Normal/Fast × Greenfield/Brownfield
✅ **Research Lead ready:** Agent + 4 CIS agents + Mary dual-context support
✅ **Documentation consolidated:** docs/ is source of truth
✅ **Git strategy consistent:** `dev` branch everywhere

### Next Steps (operator's choice)
1. Test Research Lead autonomous run (first smoke test)
2. Continue fleai-market-v4 implementation with updated PL AGENTS.md
3. Decide if fleai-market-v4 PL needs fresh session (184k/200k context)

## Research Lead Test Launch (16:13 CST)

### Spawn Details
- **Session:** `agent:research-lead:subagent:0846df01-4562-4255-a586-55698bb67dc0`
- **Label:** `research-20260217-1613`
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Timeout:** 1 hour (3600s)
- **Cleanup:** keep (preserve session for debugging)

### Workflow Launched
1. Phase 1: Mary discovering pain points (12-17 min)
2. Phase 2: Registry check & registration (2 min)
3. Phase 3: CIS ideation — spawn 4 personas (5-8 min)
4. Phase 4: Mary selecting best solution (5-8 min)
5. Phase 5: Mary competitive deep-dive (8-12 min)
6. Phase 6: Compile intake.md (4-5 min)

### Expected Outcome
- **Timeline:** 36-52 minutes (target: ~40 min)
- **Output:** `projects-queue/<project-name>-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/intake.md`
- **Subagents spawned:** Mary (3×), Carson, Victor, Maya, Quinn
- **Deduplication:** 3 registry checkpoints (Phases 2, 4, 6)

### Gateway Config Update
- Added Kelly Router spawn permissions: `allowAgents: ["research-lead", "project-lead"]`
- Gateway restarted successfully at 16:13 CST

### Status
🔬 **LIVE TEST** - First autonomous Research Lead run in progress
📊 Monitoring for completion announcement (~16:50-17:05 CST estimate)

## Orchestrator Session Creation - Critical Learning (16:19-16:24 CST)

### Problem
Kelly repeatedly tried to spawn Project Lead and Research Lead as sub-agents using `sessions_spawn()`. This fails because:
- Sub-agents CANNOT spawn their own sub-agents
- PL and RL need to spawn John, Sally, Winston, etc.
- Therefore PL and RL must be FULL sessions (orchestrators), not sub-agents

### Root Cause
Missing documentation in Kelly's AGENTS.md on how to create orchestrator sessions. Kelly kept asking the operator "how do I create a new PL session?"

### Solution
**Added "Creating New Orchestrator Sessions" section to AGENTS.md**

**Correct method:**
```bash
openclaw agent \
  --agent project-lead \
  --session-id project-{projectId} \
  --message "Start new project..."
```

This creates a NEW top-level session that can spawn sub-agents.

**Wrong method (Kelly kept trying this):**
```javascript
sessions_spawn({ agentId: "project-lead", ... })
```
This spawns PL as Kelly's sub-agent → can't spawn its own sub-agents → fails.

### Session Hierarchy
```
Kelly (main session) 
├─> PL orchestrator session ──> John, Sally, Winston (sub-agents)
└─> RL orchestrator session ──> Mary, Carson, Victor (sub-agents)
```

### Documentation Update
- Added complete CLI examples to AGENTS.md
- Fixed Research Lead workflow (was using sessions_spawn incorrectly)
- Clarified PL/RL are full sessions, not sub-agents
- Committed as `51ffc79`: "docs: add orchestrator session creation protocol to AGENTS.md"

### First Correct Usage
- Created fleai-market-v5 Project Lead session at 16:24 CST
- Session key: `agent:project-lead:project-fleai-market-v5`
- Running Normal Greenfield mode (full BMAD planning)
- Kelly will never ask "how do I create a PL session" again

### Key Lesson
**Tools vs Documentation:** Some critical workflows need documentation in AGENTS.md, not new tools. Creating orchestrator sessions is Kelly's core responsibility — she needed procedural guidance, not a new skill.

## kelly-dashboard Downtime Fix (16:23-16:28 CST)

### Problem
- Operator reported dashboard down/stuck reloading
- Dashboard dev server was running from old location: `projects/kelly-dashboard`
- All API routes returning 404 (looking for `projects/{name}/project-state.json`)
- Projects had moved to new structure: `projects/active/{name}/`

### Root Cause
Factory folder reorganization moved projects to `active/ideas/shipped/archived` subfolders, but:
1. Dashboard dev server still running from old location
2. API routes hardcoded to old path structure
3. launchd service config had old paths

### Fix Applied
1. **Killed old dev server** processes (PIDs 70826, 70827)
2. **Started fresh dev server** from correct location: `projects/active/kelly-dashboard`
3. **Updated API route** (`app/api/project-state/route.ts`):
   - Changed from single folder search to multi-folder search
   - Now searches: active/, ideas/, shipped/, archived/
   - Backward compatible with old projects
4. **Fixed launchd service** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.kelly-dashboard.plist`):
   - WorkingDirectory: `projects/kelly-dashboard` → `projects/active/kelly-dashboard`
   - Binary path: updated to new location
   - Log paths: updated to new location

### Result
✅ Dashboard operational at http://localhost:3000
✅ API routes returning 200 (finding project-state.json in new locations)
✅ launchd service will work correctly on next system restart

### Lesson
Infrastructure updates (folder structure changes) require corresponding updates to:
- Running services/dev servers
- API route path logic
- System service configs (launchd, systemd, etc.)

## API Billing Error (16:28 CST)

### Incident
Research Lead task `research-20260217-1613` hit billing error after 14m11s
- **Session:** agent:research-lead:subagent:0846df01-4562-4255-a586-55698bb67dc0
- **Error:** API provider out of credits / insufficient balance
- **Runtime:** 14m11s (out of expected 36-52 min)
- **Tokens:** 200k context (259 in / 37.1k out)
- **Impact:** Task incomplete, operator needs to top up API account

### Status
⚠️ **BLOCKING** - All Research Lead + CIS agent tasks blocked until API credits restored

### Action Required
Operator must top up API provider account or switch to different API key

## Session Creation Mechanics - Corrected Understanding (16:49 CST)

### `openclaw agent --session-id` Does NOT Control Session Key

**Discovery:** `--session-id` flag on `openclaw agent` controls the **internal UUID**, NOT the session key suffix.

**Evidence:**
- Ran: `openclaw agent --agent research-lead --session-id test-20260217-1641 --message "..."`
- Expected key: `agent:research-lead:test-20260217-1641`
- Actual key: `agent:research-lead:main`
- The `--session-id` value was used as the internal UUID, not the routing key

### Three Methods Compared

| Method | Full orchestrator? | Controls session key? | Use when |
|--------|---|---|---|
| `openclaw agent --agent <id>` | ✅ Yes | ❌ Always `:main` | Single RL session, one-off tasks |
| `openclaw gateway call agent --params '{"sessionKey":"..."}'` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Exact key | Per-project PL sessions, batch RL |
| `sessions_spawn(...)` | ❌ Subagent | N/A | Never for PL/RL |

### AGENTS.md Correction
- **Previous commit `51ffc79`:** Marked `openclaw agent --session-id` as "WRONG" (too harsh)
- **Fix commit `f2dcfbd`:** Changed to "⚠️ LIMITED" — it works but always routes to `:main`
- **`gateway call agent`** remains the "✅ CORRECT" method for custom session keys
- `idempotencyKey` is required (use `uuidgen`)

### Key Insight
Session KEY (routing identity) ≠ Session ID (internal UUID). The CLI `--session-id` sets the latter. Only `gateway call agent` with explicit `sessionKey` param sets the former.

## fleai-market-v5 BMAD Progress (16:49 CST)

### Planning Pipeline Status
- **PL Session:** `agent:project-lead:project-fleai-market-v5` (active, fresh context)
- **John (PRD):** Attempt 3 — active, fresh restart
- **Sally (UX Design):** ✅ COMPLETE — 9m8s, 20+ wireframes, 5 user flows, full design system
- **Winston (Architecture):** 🟡 ACTIVE — system architecture in progress
- **Artifacts created:** intake.md, prd.md, ux-design.md
- **Artifacts pending:** architecture.md, epics, stories-parallelization.json

### Research Lead Run #2
- **Session:** `agent:research-lead:main` (full orchestrator, 125k/200k context)
- **Created via:** `openclaw agent --agent research-lead` (routes to `:main`, fine for single session)
- **Status:** Running autonomously
- **Previous attempt:** Hit billing error at 14m; this run appears to be progressing

## Research Lead - ClientSignal Product Brief (17:00-17:31 CST)

### Completion
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Output:** `projects-queue/clientsignal-2026-02-17-1731/intake.md` (17KB)
- **Session:** `agent:research-lead:1` (created via `gateway call agent`)
- **Product:** AI-powered customer intelligence platform — contextual survey orchestration
- **Description:** Smart feedback collection that adapts in real-time based on user responses, with AI-powered analysis for product/support/marketing teams

### Session Management
- **Closed:** `agent:research-lead:main` (stale session from earlier)
- **Created:** `agent:research-lead:1` (fresh session, proper naming convention)
- **Naming pattern:** `agent:research-lead:{number}` for sequential runs

### Announcement Routing Fix (commit b08ae4b)
- **Issue:** Research Lead was using `sessions_send(label: "main", message: "...")` for completion announcements
- **Problem:** `label` parameter doesn't work reliably for routing
- **Fix:** Changed to `sessionKey: "agent:main:main"` (explicit session key)
- **Result:** Announcements now route correctly to Kelly main session

### Research Registry Cleanup
- **Removed:** timecraft product (operator request)
- **Current registry:** ClientSignal only

## fleai-market-v5 - Multiple Session Wedges & Fresh Restart (17:00-17:40 CST)

### Problem Pattern
Multiple PL sessions for fleai-market-v5 wedged during John epics creation:
1. First attempt: Wedged on `sessions_send` to John during gateway restart
2. Second attempt: Wedged again on John epics spawn
3. Third attempt: Wedged on John epics spawn

### Root Cause
- **Technical:** Sessions block on failed tool calls (e.g., `sessions_send` during gateway restart) and can't process subsequent messages including heartbeats
- **State pollution:** Multiple failed attempts left stale BMAD artifacts (prd.md, ux-design.md, epics.md)
- **Need:** Gateway-level session recovery for transient tool call failures (proposal created)

### Session Killing
Killed all stuck fleai-market-v5 PL sessions:
- Multiple attempts to restart John epics creation failed
- Sessions couldn't recover from wedged state
- External `openclaw sessions close` required

### Fresh Restart (17:31 CST)
- **Cleaned:** Removed ALL `_bmad-output/` artifacts (kept intake.md only)
- **Session:** New `agent:project-lead:project-fleai-market-v5` session created via `gateway call agent`
- **Mode:** Normal Greenfield — full 8-step planning pipeline
- **Start:** 17:31 CST message sent to PL
- **Status:** John (create-prd) spawned at 17:35 CST

### Normal Greenfield Pipeline Clarified
Full 8-step planning sequence before implementation:
1. **John (PRD):** Product Requirements Document
2. **Sally (UX):** User experience design, wireframes, flows
3. **Winston (Arch):** System architecture
4. **John (Epics):** Break PRD into epics
5. **John (Gate Check):** Review epics for quality/feasibility
6. **Bob (Sprint Planning):** Sequence epics into implementation order
7. **Bob (Dependency Graph):** Create stories-parallelization.json
8. **Bob (Create Stories):** Generate story-*.md files

Then parallel implementation begins (dependency-driven spawning).

### 5-Minute Status Check (17:36 CST)
- **John (create-prd):** Active since 17:35 CST
- **Artifacts:** No `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` directory created yet
- **Assessment:** Normal for early task execution (John still working on PRD)
- **Next check:** ~18:10 CST (30-45 min window for PRD completion)

### Planning Completion (18:11 CST)
- **Status:** 62% complete (5/8 steps done)
- ✅ John (PRD) — 6m39s
- ✅ Sally (UX) — 9m39s  
- ✅ Winston (Architecture) — 10m55s
- ✅ John (Epics) — 6m14s (attempt 2, after interactive workflow fix)
- 🟡 John (Gate Check) — Active since 18:11 CST
- ⏳ Bob (Sprint Planning, Dependency Graph, Create Stories) — Waiting

**ETA to implementation start:** ~30-40 minutes (3 Bob tasks remaining)

## Research Lead Configuration (18:16 CST)

### Operator Request
Wants Research Lead to focus on **B2C web apps** instead of generating B2B ideas like BenchmarkIQ.

### Solution Implemented
Created `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-research-lead/research-config.json`:
```json
{
  "ideaConstraints": {
    "businessModel": ["B2C"],
    "platform": ["web-app"],
    "categories": [],
    "avoidCategories": ["B2B", "enterprise", "agency-tools"],
    "notes": "Focus on consumer-facing web applications"
  }
}
```

### Agent Updates
- **Research Lead AGENTS.md:** Phase 1 now reads config and passes constraints to Mary
- **Mary AGENTS.md:** Phase 1 now filters pain points by businessModel, platform, and avoidCategories
- **Format:** Constraints passed in Mary's task string (interpolated by Research Lead)

### Effect
Next Research Lead run will only discover B2C consumer pain points for web apps (no more B2B agency tools like BenchmarkIQ).

## Gateway Session Recovery Proposal (17:15 CST)

### Problem
When tool calls fail due to transient errors (gateway restart, ECONNREFUSED, timeouts), sessions wedge:
- Session blocks waiting for tool call response
- Can't process subsequent messages (including heartbeats)
- Requires external session killing (Kelly can't fix)

### Solution Proposed
**Gateway-level auto-retry for transient errors:**
- Detect transient failures: gateway closed, ECONNREFUSED, connect timeout
- Exponential backoff: [100ms, 500ms, 2s]
- Session continues after failure instead of wedging
- Configurable per-agent

### Documentation
Created `docs/gateway-session-recovery-proposal.md` with complete implementation spec.

### Why Gateway-Level
- **Lighter-weight** than Kelly monitoring (immediate recovery, no polling)
- **Generic** — helps all agents, not just PL
- **Immediate** — recovers on next tool call, no wait for heartbeat
- **Reduces Kelly burden** — Kelly monitors logical stalls, gateway handles technical failures

### Kelly's Role After Gateway Recovery
Kelly's heartbeat becomes **safety net for logical stalls only** (>60min no progress), not technical failures.

## TakeoutTrap Project Launch (19:33 CST)

### Session Creation
- **Session:** `agent:project-lead:project-takeouttrap` (created via `gateway call agent`)
- **Mode:** Normal Greenfield (full 8-step BMAD planning)
- **Product:** Browser extension to intervene at DoorDash/Uber Eats checkout with healthier/cheaper alternatives
- **Tech Stack:** Chrome Extension + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + OpenAI API + Firebase
- **Trigger:** Operator selected TakeoutTrap from Research Lead #2 output
- **Started:** 2026-02-17 19:33 CST

### Step 1 Complete - John (PRD) (19:33-19:43 CST)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Artifact:** 69KB comprehensive PRD created
- **Output:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

### Step 2 In Progress - Sally (UX) (19:43-20:00+ CST)
- **First attempt:** 19:43 CST - Failed ("No artifact created - workflow exploration only")
- **Retry:** 19:54 CST - Active, in progress
- **Issue:** Sally's first spawn may have been exploratory (reading PRD, planning approach) without creating artifact
- **Expected:** UX design wireframes + flows + design system

### Planning Timeline
- **ETA to implementation start:** ~40-50 min from 19:33 start (expected ~20:13-20:23 CST)
- **Remaining steps:** Winston (Arch), John (Epics), John (Gate Check), Bob (Sprint Planning), Bob (Dependency Graph), Bob (Create Stories)

## Web Search Tool Migration (19:39-19:42 CST)

### Problem
- Research Lead + Mary using Brave Search API (`web_search` tool) → rate limits + billing errors
- Earlier Research Lead run hit API billing error at 14 min into task
- Brave API super limited for high-volume research workloads

### Solution Applied
**Migrated to web-search skill (SearXNG local Docker):**
- **Tool:** `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/web-search/bin/search "query"`
- **Backend:** SearXNG local Docker on localhost:8888
- **Benefits:** No rate limits, no API costs, built specifically for high-volume research
- **Status:** `docker ps | grep searxng` confirms running (3 days uptime)

### Files Updated
**AGENTS.md (spawning instructions):**
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-bmm-mary/AGENTS.md`
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-research-lead/AGENTS.md`

**TOOLS.md (default tool guidance for ALL agents):**
- Main workspace + Research Lead + Project Lead + Mary + all 9 BMAD agents + Kelly main workspace
- Total: 14 TOOLS.md files updated with web-search default section

### Impact
- Current 20-session batch (started 19:31 CST) still using old tool (started before change)
- Future Research Lead sessions will use web-search skill (no billing issues)
- All agents now default to web-search skill for web queries

## TOOLS.md Standardization (19:42-19:51 CST)

### Why
Operator asked: "We have these web skills, where should those go on the tools.md? Let's just assume every app is web for now."

### Changes Applied

#### 1. Web-Browser Skill Added (19:46 CST)
**Documentation added to TOOLS.md (main + agent workspaces):**
- **Backend:** Playwright CDP → persistent Chrome profile
- **Zero clicks:** Fully automated (navigate, click, fill forms, screenshot)
- **Persistent sessions:** Stay logged into Firebase/GCP/Vercel/GitHub
- **Use cases:** Web app QA, dashboard automation, logged-in workflows

**Agent workspaces updated:**
- Project Lead — needs web-browser for QA phase (verify deployed apps)
- Amelia — needs web-browser for testing implementations
- Barry — needs web-browser for fast-track QA

**Commit:** `2fca09c` — "docs(tools): add web-browser skill to TOOLS.md"

#### 2. Firebase-CLI Skill Added (19:48 CST)
**Documentation added to TOOLS.md (main + agent workspaces):**
- **CLI-first:** Automate Firebase + GCP project creation
- **Complete backend provisioning:** Auth, Firestore, Hosting, Functions via CLI
- **SDK config generation:** Get firebaseConfig automatically

**Agent workspaces updated:**
- Project Lead — needs firebase-cli for backend setup
- Winston — needs firebase-cli for architecture implementation
- Amelia — needs firebase-cli for backend configuration

**Commit:** `38ef0b0` — "docs(tools): add firebase-cli skill to TOOLS.md"

#### 3. Factory Assumption Documented
**Added to TOOLS.md:**
- "Assume all factory projects are web apps unless specified otherwise"
- web-browser + firebase-cli skills available by default for QA/testing and backend setup

### TOOLS.md Best Practice Established

**Distinction clarified:**
- **TOOLS.md:** Tool preferences, environment-specific notes ("what tools to use")
- **AGENTS.md:** Behavioral rules, workflow instructions ("how to behave")

**Progressive disclosure pattern:**
- TOOLS.md lists skills with brief descriptions (lightweight awareness)
- Agents read full SKILL.md when task requires detailed guidance
- Avoids documentation bloat while maintaining discoverability

**Example:** TOOLS.md says "web-browser skill available for logged-in automation", agent reads `/path/to/web-browser/SKILL.md` when actually automating a browser flow.

### Files Updated
**Total: 15 TOOLS.md files**
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/TOOLS.md` (main workspace, all agents inherit)
- 14 agent workspaces: Research Lead, Project Lead, Mary, all 9 BMAD agents (John, Sally, Winston, Bob, Barry, Carson, Victor, Maya, Quinn), Kelly main workspace

## Research Lead Batch Investigation (19:31-20:00 CST)

### Batch Launch
- **Sessions:** `agent:research-lead:3` through `agent:research-lead:22` (20 total)
- **Launch time:** 2026-02-17 19:31 CST
- **Method:** `openclaw gateway call agent` with explicit sessionKey + idempotencyKey
- **Expected completion:** ~20:10-20:20 CST (40-50 min per session)
- **Constraints:** B2C businessModel, web-app platform, avoid B2B/enterprise/agency-tools

### Results (as of 20:00 CST)
**12 project directories created (60% success rate):**
1. benchmarkiq-2026-02-17-1802
2. cancelchampion-2026-02-17-1944
3. cancelpilot-2026-02-17-1944
4. clearrate-2026-02-17-1952
5. done-ish-2026-02-17-1942
6. intentstack-2026-02-17-1951
7. mealmemory-2026-02-17-1950
8. now-or-never-2026-02-17-1942
9. patternwitness-2026-02-17-1947
10. redux-2026-02-17-1948
11. valuestream-20260217-1950
12. (one more, need to verify)

**8 sessions missing/failed (no project directories):**
- Need to examine session logs for failure reasons
- Possible causes: API errors, registry conflicts, Mary/CIS spawn failures, timeout issues

### Status Check (sessions.json)
- All 20 sessions showed activity in last 20 minutes per sessions.json
- But only 12 project directories exist
- Investigation needed: Why did 8 sessions run without producing output?

### Key Questions
1. Did failed sessions hit API billing errors?
2. Did registry coordination prevent some sessions from creating projects?
3. Did Mary or CIS agents fail to spawn properly?
4. Did sessions timeout before completing Phase 6 (package intake.md)?

### Impact on Future Runs
- **Batch sessions still using Brave API** (started before web-search skill fix)
- Future runs will use web-search skill (should be more reliable)
- May need to add error handling/retry logic for Phase 6 packaging

### Operator Decision Pending
- Review 12 completed product briefs in projects-queue/
- Decide whether to investigate failed sessions or accept 60% success rate
- Consider re-running failed sessions with web-search skill

## BMAD Workflow Paths Fix (20:10-20:20 CST)

### Problem Discovered
Sally UX on TakeoutTrap failed with "workflow exploration only" — spent 11 min reading but didn't create ux-design.md artifact.

**Root cause:** ALL BMAD agent AGENTS.md files had incorrect workflow paths.

### Incorrect Path Pattern
```
{project}/_bmad/workflows/bmm/{workflow-name}.md
```

### Actual BMAD Structure
```
{project}/_bmad/{module}/workflows/{phase}/{workflow-name}/{file}
```

Where:
- **{module}:** `bmm` (BMAD Method Module) or `tea` (Test Architect Enterprise)
- **{phase}:** `1-analysis/`, `2-plan-workflows/`, `3-solutioning/`, `4-implementation/`, `bmad-quick-flow/`, `document-project/`, `generate-project-context/`, `qa/`, `testarch/`
- **{file}:** `workflow.md`, `instructions.xml`, `instructions.md`, `workflow.yaml` (varies by workflow)

### Fix Applied
Updated all 8 BMAD agent AGENTS.md files with correct workflow paths:

**John (PM):**
- create-prd → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/create-prd/workflow-create-prd.md`
- edit-prd → `workflow-edit-prd.md`
- create-epics-and-stories → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/workflow.md`
- check-implementation-readiness → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/check-implementation-readiness/workflow.md`

**Sally (UX):**
- create-ux-design → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/create-ux-design/workflow.md`

**Winston (Architect):**
- create-architecture → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-architecture/workflow.md`
- document-project → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/document-project/instructions.md` + `workflow.yaml`
- generate-project-context → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/generate-project-context/workflow.md`

**Bob (SM):**
- sprint-planning → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/sprint-planning/instructions.md` + `workflow.yaml`
- create-story → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/instructions.xml` + `workflow.yaml`

**Amelia (Dev):**
- dev-story → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/instructions.xml` + `workflow.yaml`
- code-review → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/code-review/instructions.xml` + `workflow.yaml`

**Barry (QF):**
- quick-spec → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/bmad-quick-flow/quick-spec/workflow.md`
- quick-dev → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/bmad-quick-flow/quick-dev/workflow.md`

**Murat (TEA):**
- automate → `_bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/automate/instructions.md` + `workflow.yaml`
- test-review → `_bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/test-review/instructions.md` + `workflow.yaml`
- trace → `_bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/trace/instructions.md` + `workflow.yaml`
- nfr-assess → `_bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/nfr-assess/instructions.md` + `workflow.yaml`

**Mary (Analyst):**
- create-product-brief → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/create-product-brief/workflow.md`
- research → `_bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/research/workflow-{domain,market,technical}-research.md`

### Why John Succeeded But Sally Failed
- **John (Opus 4.6):** Smart enough to explore and find correct path, or write good PRD without strictly following workflow
- **Sally (Sonnet 4.5):** Tried to follow instructions literally, couldn't find workflow file, so "explored" without producing output

### Files Changed
```
/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-bmm-john/AGENTS.md
/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-bmm-sally/AGENTS.md

/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-tea-murat/AGENTS.md
/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/workspace-bmad-bmm-mary/AGENTS.md
```

**Note:** Agent workspace files are in `~/.openclaw/workspace-*/`, NOT in clawd repo, so cannot be committed to git.

### Impact
- **Immediate:** Sally's retry on TakeoutTrap (started 19:54 CST) should now succeed with correct workflow path
- **Future:** All BMAD agents will read correct workflow paths on first try
- **No docs updates required:** No BMAD workflow path references found in `/Users/austenallred/clawd/docs/`

### Docs Check
- Verified via grep: no BMAD workflow path references in `/Users/austenallred/clawd/docs/` → no documentation updates needed

### Memory
Created `/Users/austenallred/clawd/memory/bmad-workflow-paths-fix-2026-02-17.md` with complete fix documentation
