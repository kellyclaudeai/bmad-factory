# 2026-02-18 Daily Notes

## fleai-market-v5 TEA Testing Stall & Recovery

### Stall Detection (11:47 CST)
- **Kelly safety net triggered:** 71 minutes with no file updates on fleai-market-v5
- **Root cause:** Murat TEA session 369b796f spawned 10:36 CST, died at 10:46 CST (only 1/4 workflows complete)
- **Last update:** project-state.json at 10:36 CST
- **Expected:** 20-30 minute TEA completion, actual: session died after 10 minutes

### Safety Net Protocol Executed
1. **Heartbeat check (11:47 CST):** Detected stall >60 minutes
2. **Escalation to Project Lead:** "Status check - any blockers? (Kelly safety net ping)"
3. **Project Lead response:** Confirmed dead session, recommended Option 1 (restart TEA with fresh Murat)
4. **Operator decision (Kelly):** Approved Option 1 for complete TEA validation (all 4 workflows)

### Recovery (11:49-12:01 CST)
- **Fresh Murat spawn:** Session 9c99825a at 11:49 CST
- **Completion:** 12:00 CST (10 minutes total, within expected range)
- **Deliverables:** Test suite, traceability matrix, NFR audit (performance, security, rate limiting)
- **Phase 4 deployment:** Dev server started 12:00 CST (PID 83461)
- **User QA surfaced:** 12:01 CST at http://localhost:3000

### Key Learnings
- **Kelly safety net works:** 60-minute threshold caught stall effectively
- **Project Lead autonomy:** Analyzed situation, recommended recovery path
- **Operator decision authority:** Kelly (operator role) approved full validation over shortcuts
- **TEA retry reliability:** Second attempt succeeded without issues

## takeouttrap Code Review & Remediation

### Code Review Results (10:34-11:03 CST)
- **Total stories:** 28 implemented, 9 unstarted
- **Review outcome:** 12 PASSED, 10 BLOCKED
- **Passing stories:** 1.8, 3.2, 1.5, 1.4, 1.2, 1.9, 1.7, 1.11, 1.6, 2.1, 3.1, 3.3
- **Blocked stories:** 1.1, 1.3, 1.10, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.10

### Remediation Started (11:05 CST)
- **First batch:** 3 fix sessions spawned (stories 1.10, 2.8, 2.6)
- **Strategy:** Prioritize critical blockers first, then queue remaining 7 stories
- **Status (12:06 CST):** 61 minutes elapsed, monitoring for stall threshold

### Critical Issues Found
- **Story 1.1:** 129 ESLint errors
- **Story 1.10:** Test code in production (auto-dismiss after 3s)
- **Story 2.2:** Acceptance criteria violations (cook time/cost)
- **Story 2.3:** Cook time AC violation (72min), false vegetarian claims
- **Story 2.4:** Duplicate recipes (52→50 after fix)
- **Story 2.5:** Redis caching bug, no error handling
- **Story 2.6:** Multi-story commit (2.6+3.4+3.6), skipped integration test
- **Story 2.7:** 3 blockers (performance testing, manual QA, auth modal)
- **Story 2.8:** Rating prompt not integrated, component unreachable
- **Story 2.10:** 3 deployment blockers (migration, integration, credentials)

## 4-Tier Fallback System Validation

### Production Validation (10:26-10:36 CST)
- **Story 3.6 retry #2:** Succeeded with Claude Code (Tier 3), 10 minutes
- **TakeoutTrap 2.8 retry:** Succeeded with Claude Code, 8 minutes
- **TakeoutTrap 3.2 retry:** Succeeded with Claude Code, 7 minutes

### Fallback Architecture
- **Location:** `build/coding-cli/bin/code-with-fallback`
- **Tiers:** Codex GPT plan → Codex API key → Claude Code Anthropic plan → Claude Code API key
- **Auto-detection:** Billing/rate/quota errors trigger automatic cascade
- **Inheritance:** Amelia, Barry, Murat all use shared wrapper (DRY principle)

## Active Projects Summary (12:06 CST)

### Ready for User QA (4 projects)
1. **calculator-app:** http://localhost:3000 (Barry Fast Mode, 6 stories)
2. **kelly-dashboard:** http://localhost:3000 (21 stories, 20 complete)
3. **daily-todo-tracker:** http://localhost:3011 (Barry Fast Mode, 7 stories)
4. **fleai-market-v5:** http://localhost:3000 (Normal Greenfield, 48 stories, TEA validated)

### In Progress (1 project)
1. **takeouttrap:** 12 stories passing code review, 10 blocked (3 fixes active, 7 queued)

## Kelly Safety Net Protocol

### Design Intent
- **Purpose:** Catch edge cases where Project Lead doesn't proactively notify or report issues
- **Threshold:** 60 minutes with no file updates (project-state.json or implementation-state.md)
- **Process:** Ping Project Lead → wait 5 minutes → escalate to operator if blocked/no response
- **Philosophy:** Safety net, not primary monitoring (Project Lead should notify proactively)

### First Production Test (Today)
- **Trigger:** fleai-market-v5 stalled 71 minutes
- **Outcome:** Successfully caught stall, escalated, recovered with fresh Murat spawn
- **Validation:** Protocol works as designed

## Context Window Compactions

### Pre-Compaction State Flushes
1. **10:42 CST:** Before first compaction (Story 3.6 completion updates)
2. **11:31 CST:** Before second compaction (TEA testing in progress)
3. **12:06 CST:** Before third compaction (TEA recovery complete, fleai-market-v5 in User QA)

### State File Updates
- **factory-state.md:** Updated all project statuses, pending actions, waiting-on lists
- **heartbeat-state.json:** Updated project checks, surfacedQA list, last check timestamps
- **memory/2026-02-18.md:** This file (daily notes for continuity)

## Key Decisions

1. **fleai-market-v5 TEA recovery:** Option 1 (full TEA restart) chosen over Option 2 (skip to manual testing)
   - Rationale: Story 3.6 (AP2) is launch blocker, deserves thorough validation
   - Time cost: 20-30 minutes acceptable for confidence boost

2. **takeouttrap remediation strategy:** Fix critical blockers in batches
   - First batch: 3 stories (1.10, 2.8, 2.6) started 11:05 CST
   - Remaining: 7 stories queued after first batch completes

3. **Kelly safety net threshold:** 60 minutes validated as effective
   - Catches real stalls without false positives
   - Allows normal work to proceed without interruption

## Next Actions

1. **fleai-market-v5:** Awaiting operator QA testing (http://localhost:3000)
2. **takeouttrap:** Monitor 3 active fix sessions (61 min elapsed, approaching threshold)
3. **Other QA projects:** calculator-app, kelly-dashboard, daily-todo-tracker awaiting testing
4. **Research Lead workflow:** Design proposal ready, awaiting operator confirmation

---

## Phase 3 Quality Gate Redesign (12:00-12:11 CST)

### Problem Identified

**Original Phase 3 (TEA):**
- 4 sequential workflows: automate → test-review → trace → nfr-assess
- Runtime: 56+ minutes for fleai-market-v5 (too slow)
- `automate` (test generation): Redundant - Amelia writes tests during implementation
- `test-review`: Reviewing tests we just generated (redundant)
- `trace` (requirements traceability matrix): Compliance paperwork, not bug catching
- `nfr-assess` (NFR assessment): Only workflow actually useful for security/performance
- **Never actually tested if the app works** (no functional testing)

### New Phase 3: Quality Gate

**Normal Mode - Comprehensive:**
1. **Build + Test Verification (sequential):**
   - `npm run build` (catches compile errors)
   - `npm test` (runs Amelia's tests from implementation)
   - If FAIL: Create fix story, back to dependency-driven implementation

2. **Quality Assessment (parallel spawn):**
   - Murat E2E: Browser automation testing PRD functional requirements
   - Murat NFR: Security & performance assessment (nfr-assess workflow)
   - Both run simultaneously (~15-20 min each)

3. **Remediation (dependency-driven):**
   - Categorize bugs: BLOCKER/HIGH → fix stories | MEDIUM/LOW → defer to User QA
   - Create fix story files: `{story-id}-fix-{n}.md`
   - Bob analyzes fix dependencies → `fix-dependency-graph.json`
   - **Same dependency-driven spawning as Phase 2** (no artificial batching)
   - Each fix spawns immediately when its dependsOn array satisfied
   - Unlimited parallelism (spawn all independent fixes simultaneously)
   - Re-run Quality Gate after fixes
   - Repeat until clean

**Fast Mode - Simplified (Barry):**
1. Build check (Barry fixes inline)
2. Test suite (Barry fixes inline)
3. Basic smoke test (dev server boots, homepage loads)
4. If FAIL: Create fix story, back to dependency-driven implementation

### Key Improvements

**Removed:**
- ❌ Test generation (Amelia does this)
- ❌ Test review (redundant)
- ❌ Traceability matrix (compliance paperwork)

**Added:**
- ✅ E2E functional testing (browser automation against PRD FRs)
- ✅ Parallel execution (E2E + NFR simultaneously)
- ✅ Fix stories with dependency-driven spawning (same as Phase 2)
- ✅ Security & performance focus (practical, not bureaucratic)

**Benefits:**
- Normal Mode: 20-27 min clean pass (vs 56+ min sequential TEA)
- With fixes: 57-87 min (still faster than old TEA + fixes would be)
- Actually catches functional bugs users will hit
- Compliance checks we care about (HIPAA, security, performance)
- No artificial batching anywhere (all code implementation is dependency-driven)

### Files Updated

1. **docs/core/project-lead-flow.md:**
   - Phase 3 rewritten with parallel Quality Gate
   - Added fix story remediation section
   - Barry Fast Mode simplified Phase 3
   - Removed "wave" language, emphasized "dependency-driven spawning"

2. **workspace-project-lead/AGENTS.md:**
   - Phase 3 updated to match project-lead-flow.md
   - Normal Mode vs Fast Mode sections
   - Remediation workflow with dependency-driven fixes

3. **docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md:**
   - 12:11 CST entry documenting Phase 3 redesign

### Standardization

**All code implementation uses dependency-driven spawning:**
- Phase 2: Normal implementation (stories spawn as deps satisfied)
- Phase 3 remediation: Fix stories spawn as deps satisfied
- No artificial batching, no waves, no waiting for groups
- Bob creates dependency graph, PL spawns immediately when ready

---

## Phase 3 Correction: Bob Creates Fix Stories (12:15 CST)

**Correction identified by operator:** "Bob should be creating remediation stories, not Project Lead"

**Why this matters:**
- Bob's role: Create story files (both initial stories and fix stories)
- Project Lead's role: Orchestrate (spawn agents, track progress)
- Consistency: Bob created original stories in Phase 1, should also create fix stories in Phase 3

**Updated flow:**
1. Murat reports bugs with severity (BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
2. **Project Lead spawns Bob: create-fix-stories**
   - Input: Murat's bug reports (BLOCKER + HIGH only)
   - Output: Fix story files in stories/ directory (e.g., `2.3-fix-1.md`)
3. **Project Lead spawns Bob: create-fix-dependency-graph**
   - Input: List of fix story IDs
   - Output: fix-dependency-graph.json
4. Project Lead spawns Amelia (dependency-driven)
   - Each fix spawns when dependsOn satisfied
   - Unlimited parallelism

**Files updated:**
- docs/core/project-lead-flow.md - Phase 3 Step 2 now shows Bob creating fix stories
- workspace-bmad-tea-murat/AGENTS.md - Gate result format clarifies "Bob creates fix stories based on your bug reports"
- workspace-project-lead/AGENTS.md - Already correct (outside repo, not committed)
- docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md - Updated entry to 12:15 CST with correction note

## Research Lead Workflow v2.0 Documentation (11:02-12:10 CST)

### Problem Discovery (11:02 CST)
**Operator feedback:** Research Lead batch outputs (20 ideas from 2 batches) show concerning patterns:
- **Low diversity:** 6+ subscription-cancellation ideas (CancelChampion, CancelPilot, ClearCut, ClearRate, SpendPeace, ValueStream)
- **Formulaic naming:** Every name follows compound-word pattern (MeetCost, EventSquad, TakeoutTrap)
- **Fake randomness:** Mary's "random vertical" approach doesn't actually vary research methodology

### Root Cause Analysis
**Kelly identified 4 core issues:**
1. **Phase 1 "randomness" is superficial:** "Pick a random vertical" creates artificial constraints without varying search approach
2. **Search strategy too mechanical:** Following a checklist instead of genuine discovery
3. **Naming is formulaic:** Phase 6 always generates compound-word names
4. **No real stochastic variation:** Every session follows the same pattern with different inputs
5. **Deduplication broken:** Keyword matching missed "same pain, different name" duplicates

### Operator Refinements (11:23-12:08 CST)

**11:23 CST - Key decisions:**
1. **Research Lead makes ZERO decisions** - Pure orchestrator/delegator, all intelligence in Mary & CIS
2. **Broad → narrow funnel:** Don't start with "random vertical" - start with market signals (where is demand?) THEN dive for pain
3. **High frustration ≠ market size:** Need BOTH pain validation AND market size validation

**11:37 CST - Final design:**
1. **Config affects ALL phases:** Platform, business model, stack constraints propagate to every sub-agent (Mary, CIS, Carson)
2. **LLM-based deduplication:** 5-keyword overlap too brittle; use reasoning to evaluate "same pain, different wording"
3. **Mary generates initial name (Phase 2), Carson generates final names (Phase 6):** Mary analytical, Carson creative
4. **Config structure:** Platform (web-app/mobile-app/browser-extension), businessModel (B2C/B2B/prosumer), stack, plus future expansions

### Final Design (v2.0)

**Phase 1 (Mary) - Redesigned:**
- **Step 1: Broad Market Scanning (2-3 min)** - Google Trends, App Store rankings, Product Hunt, VC funding → find "hot zones"
- **Step 2: Pick ONE Zone + Dive for Pain (3-4 min)** - Within validated market, find gaps (Reddit, HN, Twitter, reviews)
- **Step 3: Score for BOTH Pain AND Market (4-6 min)** - 5 dimensions: Severity, Frequency, **Market Size (NEW)**, Feasibility (platform-aware), Competitive Gap
- **Step 4: Selection + Initial Naming (2-3 min)** - Pick highest score, generate analytical name

**Phase 2 (Research Lead):**
- **CHECK 1: LLM-based pain point deduplication** - Research Lead evaluates "same underlying problem?" using reasoning (not keyword matching)
- Registry stores `painPoint` field for semantic comparison

**Phase 3 (CIS - Carson, Victor, Maya, Quinn):**
- All receive config constraints in spawn message
- Generate solutions that fit platform + business model + stack

**Phase 4 & 5 (Mary):**
- Solution selection + competitive deep-dive
- Config awareness (platform, business model, stack)

**Phase 6 (Research Lead + Carson):**
- RL spawns Carson specifically for creative naming
- Carson generates 1 primary + 3-4 alternatives using **9 varied naming styles:**
  1. Compound Words (MeetCost, EventSquad)
  2. Single Evocative (Redux, Clarity, Anchor)
  3. Playful/Casual (Done-ish, Oops, Nope)
  4. Descriptive Phrases (Clear Cut, Fair Share, Now or Never)
  5. Made-up Words (Fleai = flea market + AI)
  6. Domain-style (try.app, use.app)
  7. Metaphorical (Lighthouse, Compass, Canvas)
  8. Action-oriented (Cancel, Pause, Track)
  9. Outcome-focused (Peace, Clarity, Freedom)

### Files Updated
- ✅ `docs/core/research-lead-flow.md` (v2.0 - complete rewrite, 70KB, 12:10 CST)
- ✅ `factory-state.md` (Research Lead section updated with v2.0 status)
- ✅ `memory/2026-02-18.md` (this file - design decisions captured)

### Key Insights

1. **Diversity requires varying the METHOD, not the INPUT:**
   - Asking Mary to "pick a random vertical" doesn't create diversity if search strategy stays the same
   - Broad → narrow funnel (market signals → specific pain) produces natural variation through temporal freshness

2. **Pain ≠ Market:**
   - High frustration doesn't validate market size
   - Need competitors, revenue signals, search volume, willingness to pay
   - "Loud minority" trap: 100 people complaining loudly ≠ 10,000 people with budget

3. **LLM dedup > keyword matching:**
   - "Subscription cancellation" vs "recurring charge management" = same pain, different wording
   - Keyword matching too brittle for conceptual similarity
   - LLM reasoning understands "same underlying problem?"

4. **Config as constraint propagation:**
   - Platform, business model, stack aren't just Mary's concern
   - Every phase needs to know: Are we building web app or mobile app?
   - CIS generates solutions that fit constraints
   - Carson names with platform/market context

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Workflow documented (v2.0)
- ⏳ Agent configs pending (Mary, Research Lead, Carson, Victor, Maya, Quinn, Kelly)
- ⏳ Testing pending (3-5 parallel runs to validate diversity)

### Expected Improvements

**Diversity:**
- No more 6+ subscription-cancellation variants (LLM dedup catches them)
- Varied naming styles (not all compound words)
- Multiple market segments (broad → narrow funnel explores different hot zones)

**Quality:**
- Market size validated upfront (not just pain intensity)
- Platform-aware feasibility (web vs mobile)
- Better differentiation (config constraints guide CIS ideation)

**Efficiency:**
- Fewer NO-GO outcomes (market scanning pre-validates demand)
- Fewer duplicates (LLM dedup at Phase 2 saves 40 min)

## Consolidated Remediation via correct-course (12:20-12:30 CST)

### Decision: Single Remediation Path

**Operator request:** "I'd prefer if we just use correct-course from John for ALL rejections. Then John decides how deep the correction needs to be."

**Rationale:**
- Eliminate ad-hoc remediation paths (Bob creating fix stories directly, etc.)
- John becomes the decision-maker for ALL changes (bugs, feedback, new features)
- Unified Sprint Change Management across all failure modes
- John categorizes scope (Minor/Moderate/Major) and recommends approach
- Existing BMAD correct-course workflow already designed for this

### New Flow

**ALL bugs/feedback route through John's correct-course:**

1. **Phase 3 Quality Gate:**
   - Murat runs E2E + NFR (parallel)
   - **Wait for BOTH reports** before proceeding
   - Project Lead spawns John: correct-course with both bug reports
   - John analyzes, categorizes by scope, produces Sprint Change Proposal
   - Project Lead implements based on scope classification

2. **Phase 4 User QA:**
   - Operator tests app, reports feedback
   - Project Lead spawns John: correct-course with operator feedback
   - Same flow as Phase 3

3. **Brownfield Complex New Features:**
   - New feature with architectural impact/scope uncertainty
   - Project Lead spawns John: correct-course with feature request
   - John analyzes impact, recommends approach
   - Then proceed to planning

### Scope Classifications

**MINOR (simple fix stories):**
- Code bugs (auth validation, crashes, performance issues)
- Bob creates fix story files from Sprint Change Proposal
- Bob creates fix-dependency-graph.json
- Amelia implements (dependency-driven, same as Phase 2)

**MODERATE (backlog reorganization):**
- UX issues requiring story modifications
- Feature requests within existing scope
- John updates epics.md
- Bob updates sprint-planning + dependency-graph
- Dependency-driven implementation

**MAJOR (fundamental replanning):**
- Architectural issues (caching layer, JWT redesign, microservices split)
- Scope changes (descope features, extend timeline)
- UX redesigns (checkout flow, navigation overhaul)
- Winston redesigns architecture (if arch issue)
- John updates PRD (if scope issue)
- Sally updates UX (if design issue)
- Bob updates epics + stories
- Dependency-driven implementation

### Files Updated

1. **docs/core/project-lead-flow.md:**
   - Phase 3 Step 3: Remediation via correct-course (replaced Bob direct spawning)
   - Phase 4 Scenario C: User QA feedback via correct-course
   - Brownfield: Complex new features optionally use correct-course
   - Detailed scope classification (Minor/Moderate/Major)

2. **workspace-project-lead/AGENTS.md** (outside repo):
   - Phase 3: Wait for BOTH Murat reports, spawn John correct-course
   - Phase 4: User feedback routes through correct-course

3. **workspace-bmad-bmm-john/AGENTS.md** (outside repo):
   - Added correct-course workflow section
   - Marked as CRITICAL - PRIMARY REMEDIATION WORKFLOW
   - Triggers: Quality Gate bugs, User QA feedback, Brownfield complex features
   - Scope classification responsibility

4. **workspace-bmad-bmm-bob/AGENTS.md** (outside repo):
   - correct-course integration section
   - Spawned for MINOR scope to create fix stories + dependency graph

5. **workspace-bmad-bmm-amelia/AGENTS.md** (outside repo):
   - correct-course integration note
   - Implements fix stories from MINOR scope outcomes

6. **workspace-bmad-bmm-winston/AGENTS.md** (outside repo):
   - correct-course integration for MAJOR architectural changes

7. **workspace-bmad-bmm-sally/AGENTS.md** (outside repo):
   - correct-course integration for MAJOR UX changes

8. **docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md:**
   - 12:30 CST entry documenting consolidated remediation

### Benefits

- ✅ **Single remediation path** for all failure modes
- ✅ **John makes scope decisions** (not ad-hoc by Project Lead or Bob)
- ✅ **Standardized output** (Sprint Change Proposal)
- ✅ **Already built** (correct-course exists in BMAD)
- ✅ **Flexible** (handles simple bugs, arch changes, scope changes)
- ✅ **Documented** (Sprint Change Proposal provides audit trail)

### Validation Needed

- First Quality Gate failure with this flow (fleai-market-v5 TEA results will test)
- First User QA feedback loop
- Brownfield complex feature

---

## Factory Cleanup & Fresh Slate (12:47 CST)

### All Projects Archived
**Operator request:** "Kill any and all active projects, and archive them. I want to start with a fresh slate."

**Actions taken:**
1. ✅ Moved all 5 active projects to `projects/archived/`:
   - fleai-market-v5 (48/48 stories complete, TEA passed)
   - calculator-app (6/6 stories complete, Barry Fast Mode)
   - daily-todo-tracker (7/7 stories complete, Barry Fast Mode)
   - kelly-dashboard (20/21 stories complete)
   - takeouttrap (28/37 stories, mid-remediation - archived incomplete)

2. ✅ Killed dev servers (ports 3000, 3011)

3. ✅ `projects/active/` is now empty — fresh slate ready

### Research Lead v2.0 Test Failure - Root Cause Found

**Problem:** Test session `agent:research-lead:test-20260218-1227` failed to start (0 messages, no activity)

**Root cause:** **Missing config file** at `~/.openclaw/agents/research-lead/config`

**Explanation:**
- All other BMAD agents have config files specifying their model
- Research Lead agent directory had no `config` file
- `openclaw gateway call agent` command failed silently without a config
- Session was registered but never initialized (0 messages)

**Fix applied:**
Created `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/agents/research-lead/config`:
```yaml
model:
  primary: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
```

**Next test:** Ready to retry Research Lead v2.0 test with config file in place.

### Key Learnings

1. **Agent config files are mandatory:** Even if model is specified elsewhere, agents need a `config` file
2. **Silent failures:** `openclaw gateway call agent` doesn't error loudly when config is missing
3. **Session registration ≠ initialization:** A session can be registered in sessions.json but never actually start if config is missing


---

## Session Closer Skill Updated (13:03 CST)

### Problem
- Dashboard was showing all 5 archived projects (sessions still in index)
- Python script restarts gateway after EACH close (slow, causes exec timeouts)
- No batch cleanup capability

### Solution: New Batch Scripts

**Created 2 new scripts:**

1. **`bin/close-project-batch`** - Close multiple sessions at once
   ```bash
   close-project-batch calculator-app daily-todo-tracker takeouttrap
   ```
   - Backs up sessions.json
   - Removes multiple session keys
   - Archives transcripts (.jsonl → .jsonl.deleted.<timestamp>)
   - Restarts gateway ONCE at end (faster than per-session restart)

2. **`bin/keep-only-sessions`** - Keep specific sessions, remove all others
   ```bash
   keep-only-sessions kelly-dashboard
   ```
   - Always keeps `agent:project-lead:main` (system session)
   - Removes everything else
   - Perfect for "fresh slate" scenarios
   - Single gateway restart at end

**Existing script:**
- `bin/close-project` - Single session close (still useful for one-off cleanup)

### Updated SKILL.md
- Documented batch mode vs single mode
- Added usage examples for all 3 scripts
- Explained when to use each approach (3+ sessions = use batch)

### Testing
- Manually cleaned sessions earlier using similar approach (worked)
- Scripts created + made executable
- Ready for next cleanup scenario


---

## Session Cleanup & Dashboard Restart (13:05-13:08 CST)

### Dashboard Port Issue (13:05 CST)
- **Problem:** Dashboard not visible on port 3001
- **Reality:** Dashboard running on port 3000 (dev server PID 88394)
- **Action:** Restarted `npm run dev` in kelly-dashboard project directory

### Session Cleanup (13:08 CST)
**Closed 3 sessions:**
1. `agent:main:project-fleai-market-v5-test` - Test session (archived transcript)
2. `agent:main:jason-dashupdate` - Dashboard update session (archived transcript)
3. `agent:main` (bare) - Duplicate empty session (removed)

**Duplicate Main Session Issue Explained:**
- **Problem:** Two main sessions with different key formats:
  - `agent:main` (bare) - Empty, no messages, no history
  - `agent:main:main` (double) - 200k tokens, active heartbeat, real main session
- **Explanation:** OpenClaw session key format uses `:main` as suffix for default/main session
  - `agent:main:main` = "the main session of the main agent" (correct format)
  - `agent:main` (bare) = Accidentally created duplicate (older format or config change)
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate bare session, kept `agent:main:main` (active session)

**Process:**
1. Backed up sessions.json
2. Removed 3 session entries using jq
3. Archived transcript files (renamed to `.jsonl.deleted.<timestamp>`)
4. Restarted gateway for changes to take effect

### Sessions After Cleanup (13:08 CST)
- `agent:main:matt` - Active Kelly main session
- `agent:main:main` - Heartbeat session (200k tokens)
- `agent:project-lead:kelly-dashboard` - Active (200k tokens)
- `agent:project-lead:main` - Heartbeat
- `agent:main:jason` - Active (200k tokens)
- `agent:kelly-improver:main` - Heartbeat (200k tokens)

**Dashboard Status:** Running on port 3000 (not 3001), restarted 13:05 CST

## Session Closer Skill Updated for Any Agent (13:11-13:13 CST)

### Problem
- Matrix channel session needed closing: `agent:main:matrix:channel:!wbxlmlrvmmzmzchiaf:austens-mac-mini.local`
- session-closer skill only worked with Project Lead sessions (`agent:project-lead:*`)
- Hardcoded to `~/.openclaw/agents/project-lead/sessions/` directory

### Solution: Generic Agent Support

**Updated all 3 scripts to accept `--agent` parameter:**

1. **`bin/close-project`**
   - Added `--agent <agent>` (defaults to `project-lead`)
   - Added `--session-key <key>` for full session key specification
   - Auto-detects session key vs project ID from positional args

2. **`bin/close-project-batch`**
   - Added `--agent <agent>` parameter
   - Supports mix of project IDs and full session keys
   - Example: `close-project-batch --agent main jason agent:main:matrix:channel:xyz`

3. **`bin/keep-only-sessions`**
   - Added `--agent <agent>` parameter
   - Always preserves `agent:<agent>:main` (system session)
   - Example: `keep-only-sessions --agent main jason` (keeps jason + agent:main:main, removes all others)

**Updated Python script:**
- Replaced hardcoded `AGENT_ID = "project-lead"` with dynamic `--agent` parameter
- Compute paths from agent: `~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/sessions/`
- Support both `--project-id` and `--session-key` inputs

**Updated SKILL.md:**
- Documented `--agent` parameter (defaults to `project-lead` for backward compat)
- Added examples for main agent sessions
- Added examples for Matrix channel/DM sessions
- Explained session key formats for different agents

### Usage Examples

**Close Matrix channel session:**
```bash
close-project --session-key agent:main:matrix:channel:!wbxlmlrvmmzmzchiaf:austens-mac-mini.local
```

**Close main agent session by ID:**
```bash
close-project --agent main jason
```

**Batch close multiple main sessions:**
```bash
close-project-batch --agent main jason jason-dashupdate project-test
```

**Keep only specific sessions:**
```bash
keep-only-sessions --agent main jason  # Removes all except jason + agent:main:main
```

### Closed Sessions (13:11 CST)
- `agent:main:matrix:channel:!wbxlmlrvmmzmzchiaf:austens-mac-mini.local` (Matrix group chat)

### Commit
- `4f7fa1a` — refactor(session-closer): support any agent, not just project-lead


## Dashboard Enhancement & kelly-improver Heartbeat Removal (13:17 CST)

### User Request
- **Show heartbeat sessions in dashboard** (currently hidden)
- **Remove kelly-improver heartbeat session** (user doesn't want "for now")
- **Keep project-lead heartbeat** (user wants those)

### kelly-improver Session Closure (In Progress)
- **Target:** `agent:kelly-improver:main` (heartbeat, 200k tokens)
- **Command attempted:** `close-project --agent kelly-improver --session-key "agent:kelly-improver:main"`
- **Status:** Command failed with missing tool result error
- **Next:** Retry closure, then update dashboard to show remaining heartbeat sessions

### Current Heartbeat Sessions
- `agent:main:main` (heartbeat, 200k tokens) ← KEEP
- `agent:project-lead:main` (heartbeat) ← KEEP
- `agent:kelly-improver:main` (heartbeat, 200k tokens) ← TO REMOVE

## Project Registry Lifecycle Architecture (13:10-13:25 CST)

### Operator-Driven Design Session

**Problem:** No clear lifecycle tracking for projects from discovery to shipped. projects-queue folder structure was messy (20 folders with intake.md files, no state tracking). Two separate registries (research-registry.json for dedup, factory-state.md for tracking).

**Solution: Unified project-registry.json**

**Key design decisions (operator-driven):**
1. **Single JSON file** at `/projects/project-registry.json` — no more nested folder structure
2. **5 lifecycle states:** discovery → in-progress → shipped → followup → (paused)
3. **PL owns all transitions** from discovery onward (including discovery→in-progress)
4. **No "selected" state** — operator said "not a distinction worth having" (skip straight to in-progress)
5. **Merged maintenance + enhancement** into single "followup" state — operator preferred simplicity
6. **Hard delete over soft delete** — operator prefers removing bad ideas, not archiving them
7. **Paused as a state** (not just a flag) — operator liked having it explicit
8. **Named `project-registry-workflow.md`** (not lifecycle) — avoid confusion with Project Lead

**Registry schema:**
- id, name, state, paused/pausedReason
- timeline (discoveredAt, startedAt, shippedAt, lastUpdated)
- intake (problem, solution, targetAudience, keyFeatures) — immutable after RL creates
- implementation (projectDir, qaUrl, deployedUrl, repo)
- followup[] (type, description, priority, addedAt)

**Research Lead changes:**
- Writes to project-registry.json (not projects-queue folders)
- Uses intake.problem field for LLM dedup (checks all states)
- researchPhase field tracks progress within discovery state (ideation→validation→complete)

**Project Lead changes:**
- Reads registry on project start, updates state to in-progress
- Updates qaUrl when preview deployed
- Updates state to shipped when production deployed
- Manages followup transitions

**Files created/updated:**
- ✅ `docs/core/project-registry-workflow.md` (new, 12KB)
- ✅ `projects/project-registry.json` (new, empty)
- ✅ `docs/core/research-lead-flow.md` (9 edits — registry writes, dedup, Phase 6)
- ✅ `docs/core/project-lead-flow.md` (registry responsibilities added)
- ✅ `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md` (13:15 CST entry)
- ❌ Deleted `projects-queue/` (20 directories)
- ❌ Deleted `research-registry.json` (replaced by unified registry)

### Dashboard Enhancement Complete (13:22 CST)

**Changes:**
1. **Removed kelly-improver heartbeat** (session already gone from sessions.json)
2. **Updated kelly-improver-flow.md** - removed heartbeat reference, clarified to "project monitoring, memory maintenance"
3. **Updated dashboard to show ALL sessions**:
   - Removed filter excluding project-lead sessions
   - Now shows heartbeat sessions (main:main, project-lead:main)
   - Added project-lead to priority sorting (displays after main, kelly-improver)
   - Fixed empty state message ("No sessions running" vs "No other agents running")

**Result:** Dashboard now displays all 10 sessions (was showing 8 of 11):
- main (5): matt, matrix direct, main (heartbeat), jason, matrix channel
- kelly-improver (2): matt, jason-i8
- project-lead (2): kelly-dashboard, main (heartbeat)
- BMAD agents: (remaining sessions from Barry, Mary, etc.)

**Commit:** `e9d474c` — feat(dashboard): show all sessions including heartbeats
