# 2026-02-15 — kelly-dashboard ops + UX; meeting-time-tracker Supabase pivot; Chrome CDP

## kelly-dashboard: Hosted on localhost:3000 (production)
- Dashboard is hosted via launchd + `next start` (NODE_ENV=production) on port 3000.

## kelly-dashboard: Declutter UX controls (Story 1.2)
- Implemented collapsible sections for all major home sections with persisted collapsed state.
- Added sticky View Controls bar with:
  - Descriptions toggle
  - Collapse all / Expand all

## Decision: Remove Compact toggle
- Operator feedback: Compact toggle provided no value.
- Implemented: removed Compact toggle from View Controls and removed supporting compactMode preference/state.

## Sessions API reliability
- `/api/sessions` now reads OpenClaw Gateway via `/tools/invoke` (`sessions_list`) using the configured token and parses `details.sessions` output shape.
- kelly-dashboard: updated sessions endpoint + UI to surface explicit `channel/lastChannel` from gateway session payload (avoid inferring channel from sessionKey).

---

## Decision: meeting-time-tracker should be Supabase-only
- Standardize meeting-time-tracker on Supabase (Auth + Postgres + scheduled sync). Stop mixing Firebase + Supabase.
- Rationale: relational model + RLS + migrations + scheduled jobs are a better fit; Firebase created repeated OAuth/setup friction.

## Implementation: Supabase-only cleanup committed
- `projects/meeting-time-tracker-web` standardized on Supabase server patterns and hardened migrations/RLS.
- Remaining blocker is provisioning a real Supabase project and replacing placeholder env vars.

## Browser automation decision: Chrome Relay vs Playwright CDP
- Chrome Relay requires a user gesture to attach a tab (by design).
- Attempted to attach Playwright to the *primary* Chrome profile via CDP; Chrome now requires a **non-default `--user-data-dir`** for remote debugging.
- Implemented a persistent CDP automation profile at `~/.openclaw/chrome-cdp-profile` and a launcher/LaunchAgent; user must sign in once in that profile for browser-based automation.
- Best path for Supabase is CLI-first once a Supabase PAT is provided (one-time).
