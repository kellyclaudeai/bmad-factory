## 00:08-00:15 CST - Dashboard Active Subagents Fix

**Issue:** User reported dashboard shows 0 active subagents for SlackLite even though PL logs show Bob sprint planning.

**Root cause identified:**
- Bob IS spawned as a separate OpenClaw subagent (user was right!)
- `/api/sessions` uses Gateway's `sessions_list` which only returns **top-level agent sessions**, not subagents
- `/api/active-subagents` filtered those sessions, but subagents weren't in the data to begin with
- Subagent sessions exist on disk in `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/` but weren't being read

**Fix applied:**
1. Fixed `project-registry.json`: SlackLite projectId was `null` → `"slacklite"`
2. Rewrote `/api/active-subagents` to directly read from agent session directories on disk instead of relying on Gateway API
3. New logic: Scan `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/sessions.json` → find subagents with matching projectId in label → check transcript age (<30 min) → return active subagents
4. Rebuilt dashboard production build and restarted launchd service

**Result:**
- Dashboard now correctly shows **6 active subagents** for SlackLite:
  - 3× Bob sessions (sprint, deps, stories)
  - 2× John sessions (fix-prd-epics, readiness-v2)
  - 1× Winston session (fix-arch)

## SlackLite Status
- State: in-progress (Phase 1)
- PL Session: agent:project-lead:project-slacklite (active)
- Current: Bob sprint planning (internal agent)
- Gate Check #2: John session (john-readiness-v2-slacklite) actively running, validating remediation fixes
- Waiting on: Gate Check #2 results → if PASS, Bob starts Phase 2 implementation

## Active Work
- SlackLite Phase 1: 1 active subagent (bob-stories-slacklite creating 68 story files)
  - Bob sprint, deps, John gate checks, Winston fix: all completed

## 00:41 CST - Research Lead 8 Complete: Idea Killed (10/10 solutions rejected)

**Problem:** Personal Relationship Management (iOS mobile app)  
**Result:** ❌ Quinn killed all 10/10 qualified solutions → No intake.md created

**Why it failed:**
- 20+ year graveyard: Etacts (YC→Salesforce→killed), Connected (→LinkedIn→killed), Monaru (YC 2019→dead same year)
- Platform barriers: iOS/Android block passive message/call tracking
- Behavioral paradox: Users who need it lack daily discipline to use it
- Free alternatives work: Siri Reminders, calendar notifications
- 75% journaling abandonment within 2 weeks
- Revenue reality: 2-5% freemium conversion (not 12-15%), Y1 ARR <$10K vs $30-50K dev cost

**Quinn's insight:** "Awareness ≠ action. People enjoy complaining about being 'bad friends' but won't pay $48/year to feel worse about it."

**Validation of v3.2 design:**
- ✅ Fallback queue worked (tried all 10 solutions)
- ✅ Kill gate prevented 6-week factory waste on fundamentally unsolvable problem
- ✅ Data-driven decision (graveyard research + platform constraints + economics)
- ✅ No intake.md = no project registry entry = clean exit
  
## 00:22 CST - Active Subagent Detection + Stories File Unification

**Issue 1:** Dashboard showed 6 "active" subagents but 5 had already completed
- Root cause: checked transcript age (<30 min) but transcripts get written to AFTER completion (announce-backs)
- Fix: Check for `.lock` files instead → only sessions with active locks are shown
- Result: Now correctly shows 1 active (bob-stories-slacklite)

**Issue 2:** Code looked for both `stories-parallelization.json` AND `dependency-graph.json`
- Bob only creates `dependency-graph.json` in Phase 1
- Fix: Removed `stories-parallelization.json` fallback, use `dependency-graph.json` only
- Result: Unified to canonical file
