## 00:08-00:15 CST - Dashboard Active Subagents Fix

**Issue:** User reported dashboard shows 0 active subagents for SlackLite even though PL logs show Bob sprint planning.

**Root cause identified:**
- Bob IS spawned as a separate OpenClaw subagent (user was right!)
- `/api/sessions` uses Gateway's `sessions_list` which only returns **top-level agent sessions**, not subagents
- `/api/active-subagents` filtered those sessions, but subagents weren't in the data to begin with
- Subagent sessions exist on disk in `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/` but weren't being read

**Fix applied:**
1. Fixed `project-registry.json`: SlackLite projectId was `null` → `"slacklite"`
2. Rewrote `/api/active-subagents` to directly read from agent session directories on disk instead of relying on Gateway API
3. New logic: Scan `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/sessions.json` → find subagents with matching projectId in label → check transcript age (<30 min) → return active subagents
4. Rebuilt dashboard production build and restarted launchd service

**Result:**
- Dashboard now correctly shows **6 active subagents** for SlackLite:
  - 3× Bob sessions (sprint, deps, stories)
  - 2× John sessions (fix-prd-epics, readiness-v2)
  - 1× Winston session (fix-arch)

## SlackLite Status
- State: in-progress (Phase 1)
- PL Session: agent:project-lead:project-slacklite (active)
- Current: Bob sprint planning (internal agent)
- Gate Check #2: John session (john-readiness-v2-slacklite) actively running, validating remediation fixes
- Waiting on: Gate Check #2 results → if PASS, Bob starts Phase 2 implementation

## Active Work
- Research Lead 8: Running (iOS app, v3.2 pipeline)
  - **Status:** Quinn fallback queue - killed 7/10 candidates (70% kill rate)
  - **Pattern identified:** 20+ year graveyard of YC/Sequoia failures in relationship management space
  - **Key insight:** Awareness ≠ action (fundamental unsolvability risk)
  - **Remaining:** 3 candidates (Tether Victor, Kinkeeper, Ember)
  - If all 10 killed → idea dies, no intake.md
- SlackLite Phase 1: 1 active subagent (bob-stories-slacklite creating 68 story files)
  - Bob sprint, deps, John gate checks, Winston fix: all completed
  
## 00:22 CST - Active Subagent Detection + Stories File Unification

**Issue 1:** Dashboard showed 6 "active" subagents but 5 had already completed
- Root cause: checked transcript age (<30 min) but transcripts get written to AFTER completion (announce-backs)
- Fix: Check for `.lock` files instead → only sessions with active locks are shown
- Result: Now correctly shows 1 active (bob-stories-slacklite)

**Issue 2:** Code looked for both `stories-parallelization.json` AND `dependency-graph.json`
- Bob only creates `dependency-graph.json` in Phase 1
- Fix: Removed `stories-parallelization.json` fallback, use `dependency-graph.json` only
- Result: Unified to canonical file
