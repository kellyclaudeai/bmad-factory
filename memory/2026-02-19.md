## 00:08-00:15 CST - Dashboard Active Subagents Fix

**Issue:** User reported dashboard shows 0 active subagents for SlackLite even though PL logs show Bob sprint planning.

**Root cause identified:**
- Bob IS spawned as a separate OpenClaw subagent (user was right!)
- `/api/sessions` uses Gateway's `sessions_list` which only returns **top-level agent sessions**, not subagents
- `/api/active-subagents` filtered those sessions, but subagents weren't in the data to begin with
- Subagent sessions exist on disk in `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/` but weren't being read

**Fix applied:**
1. Fixed `project-registry.json`: SlackLite projectId was `null` → `"slacklite"`
2. Rewrote `/api/active-subagents` to directly read from agent session directories on disk instead of relying on Gateway API
3. New logic: Scan `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/sessions.json` → find subagents with matching projectId in label → check transcript age (<30 min) → return active subagents
4. Rebuilt dashboard production build and restarted launchd service

**Result:**
- Dashboard now correctly shows **6 active subagents** for SlackLite:
  - 3× Bob sessions (sprint, deps, stories)
  - 2× John sessions (fix-prd-epics, readiness-v2)
  - 1× Winston session (fix-arch)

## SlackLite Status
- State: in-progress (Phase 1)
- PL Session: agent:project-lead:project-slacklite (active)
- Current: Bob sprint planning (internal agent)
- Gate Check #2: John session (john-readiness-v2-slacklite) actively running, validating remediation fixes
- Waiting on: Gate Check #2 results → if PASS, Bob starts Phase 2 implementation

## Active Work
- SlackLite Phase 1: 1 active subagent (bob-stories-slacklite creating 68 story files)
  - Bob sprint, deps, John gate checks, Winston fix: all completed

## 00:41 CST - Research Lead 8 Complete: Idea Killed (10/10 solutions rejected)

**Problem:** Personal Relationship Management (iOS mobile app)  
**Result:** ❌ Quinn killed all 10/10 qualified solutions → No intake.md created

**Why it failed:**
- 20+ year graveyard: Etacts (YC→Salesforce→killed), Connected (→LinkedIn→killed), Monaru (YC 2019→dead same year)
- Platform barriers: iOS/Android block passive message/call tracking
- Behavioral paradox: Users who need it lack daily discipline to use it
- Free alternatives work: Siri Reminders, calendar notifications
- 75% journaling abandonment within 2 weeks
- Revenue reality: 2-5% freemium conversion (not 12-15%), Y1 ARR <$10K vs $30-50K dev cost

**Quinn's insight:** "Awareness ≠ action. People enjoy complaining about being 'bad friends' but won't pay $48/year to feel worse about it."

**Validation of v3.2 design:**
- ✅ Fallback queue worked (tried all 10 solutions)
- ✅ Kill gate prevented 6-week factory waste on fundamentally unsolvable problem
- ✅ Data-driven decision (graveyard research + platform constraints + economics)
- ✅ No intake.md = no project registry entry = clean exit
  
## 00:22 CST - Active Subagent Detection + Stories File Unification

**Issue 1:** Dashboard showed 6 "active" subagents but 5 had already completed
- Root cause: checked transcript age (<30 min) but transcripts get written to AFTER completion (announce-backs)
- Fix: Check for `.lock` files instead → only sessions with active locks are shown
- Result: Now correctly shows 1 active (bob-stories-slacklite)

**Issue 2:** Code looked for both `stories-parallelization.json` AND `dependency-graph.json`
- Bob only creates `dependency-graph.json` in Phase 1
- Fix: Removed `stories-parallelization.json` fallback, use `dependency-graph.json` only
- Result: Unified to canonical file

## 08:36 CST - SlackLite Status Check (User Escalation)

**Context:** Matt asked for status update, I gave incorrect info ("started 3 hours ago, should be done soon")

**Reality check:**
- Project started: Feb 18 ~23:50 CST (yesterday, ~9 hours ago)
- Sprint progress: **2/68 stories complete (3%)**
  - ✅ Story 1.1: Next.js initialized
  - ✅ Story 1.6: Design system foundation
- **BLOCKED - Critical issues:**
  - Story 1.2 (Firebase config): Security vulnerability - RTDB /users path has NO security rules (workspace isolation bypass) + 4 MAJOR issues
  - Story 1.5 (Vercel setup): Missing GitHub secrets, DNS not configured, deployments returning 401s
- Todo: 64 remaining stories across 11 epics
- Estimated total effort: 102-153 hours

**Mistake:** Read registry `timeline.lastUpdated` (05:11 UTC) and misinterpreted as project start time. Actual start was ~9 hours prior.

**Waiting on:** Project Lead (agent:project-lead:project-slacklite) to resolve blocking security issues in stories 1.2 and 1.5 before auth/messaging work can proceed.

**Lesson:** Always check file timestamps and sprint-status.yaml for ground truth, not just registry timestamps.

## 08:41 CST - Default Compaction Failure Analysis + instinct8 Re-enabled

**Root cause of PL death loop:**
- Single exec command removed `.pnpm-store` → listed hundreds of files in output
- Massive tool result pushed session from <200k to **215k tokens instantly**
- Jumped over the `reserveTokensFloor: 35000` safety buffer in one turn
- Next API call failed with 400 error (215k > 200k limit)
- Session locked - can't respond, can't compact, can't recover

**Why default compaction failed:**
- Only runs **between turns**, not during tool result processing
- Can't prevent single massive tool output from exceeding limit
- Need compaction that runs **during** tool execution, not just after

**Fix applied:**
- Enabled `instinct8-compaction` plugin via `gateway config.patch`
- Plugin triggers at 150k tokens (earlier threshold)
- Can compact **during** tool execution when detecting size issues
- Gateway restarted via SIGUSR1

**Action taken:**
- Sent context refresh message to Project Lead session for slacklite
- Priority: Deploy Vercel to ANY domain (not slacklite.app), then fix RTDB security
- instinct8 plugin should prevent future death loops

## 08:53 CST - Session Recovery Skill Created

**Problem:** Kelly can detect frozen PL sessions but had no way to restart them autonomously.

**Solution created:**
- **Skill:** `skills/factory/session-recovery/` 
- **Script:** `bin/recover-session` - Archives transcript, clears state, sends context refresh
- **Integration:** Updated `HEARTBEAT.md` - auto-recover on stall check if 400 errors detected
- **Docs:** Updated `kelly-router-flow.md` - Session Recovery section added

**How it works:**
1. Kelly detects stalled project (>60 min no updates)
2. Pings PL, waits 5 min
3. If no response: check `sessions_history` for 400 errors
4. If frozen: run recovery script (archive transcript, clear state, refresh)
5. Alert operator: "🔧 Auto-recovered frozen PL session"

**Architecture:**
- This is a **workaround skill** until OpenClaw core adds `sessions_restart` tool
- Safe: transcripts archived, state loaded from registry, idempotent
- Logged: recovery events written to daily memory

**Future:** Proposal documented in SKILL.md for proper `sessions_restart(sessionKey, reason)` tool in OpenClaw core.

**Tested successfully:**
- Ran recovery on frozen SlackLite PL session (215k tokens → 0 tokens)
- Transcript archived to `archive/81d7f501-frozen-*`
- Session cleared and restarted with fresh context
- PL now active and responding to priorities (Vercel deploy + Firebase security)
- Fixed script bug: now deletes session state file, not just sessions.json entry

## 08:57 CST - Session Recovery: agent:project-lead:project-slacklite

**Reason:** token-overflow-death-loop
**Action:** Archived frozen transcript, cleared session state, sent context refresh
**Session ID (archived):** N/A
**Context refresh:** Context refresh after recovery from 215k token overflow. Read sprint-status.yaml and project-registry.json. Priority tasks: 1) Deploy Vercel to ANY domain (don't worry about slacklite.app), 2) Fix RTDB /users security vulnerability (BLOCKING - workspace isolation bypass).

## 09:00 CST - Git Push Failure + Clean History Rewrite

**Issue:** Push to GitHub blocked by 124.25 MB file in git history (same .pnpm-store file that killed PL session)

**Fix applied:**
- Cherry-picked clean session-recovery commits (e56cdc9b, 187770a6, e57bc030) onto origin/dev
- Created dev-clean branch, deleted old dev, renamed to dev
- Force pushed clean history to origin
- 124MB file purged from git history

**Result:** Session recovery skill commits successfully pushed to GitHub

## 09:09 CST - SlackLite Progress Update

**Status:** Both parallel Amelia tasks completed
- ✅ Story 1.2 (Security): RTDB rules fixed - prevents workspace isolation bypass (commit dbe156eb)
- ✅ Story 1.5 (Vercel): Deployed to https://slacklite.app (returns 401 - needs Firebase env vars)

**Next:** PL spawning Amelia to complete Firebase setup + Vercel env configuration → QA-ready

**Progress:** 2/68 stories → moving to 3-4/68 with Firebase setup

## 09:09 CST - Research Lead Workflow Discussion (In Progress)

**Problem identified:** Current workflow wastes 10-14 min of CIS work when Quinn kills ideas for domain-level issues

**Current flow:**
1. Mary picks problem → 8-12 min
2. CIS generates 10 solutions → 10-14 min
3. Mary scores/selects → 8-12 min
4. Quinn validates → 8-12 min (kills because domain itself is flawed)

**Proposed improvement:** Multi-stage Quinn validation
- **Stage 1 (NEW):** Quinn domain kill gate AFTER Mary picks problem, BEFORE CIS runs
  - Validates domain viability, problem signals, gap legitimacy
  - Time: 5-8 min
  - Saves: 10-14 min if domain is bad
- **Stage 2 (Keep current):** Quinn solution kill gate after Mary selects top solution
  - Validates novelty, revenue thesis, solution quality

**Waiting on:** User decision on implementation + whether to add Quinn after competitive research too

## 09:39 CST - SlackLite Status Check (Dashboard 0 Subagents)

**Query:** User asked for status update, noticed dashboard showing 0 active subagents

**Status found:**
- **Progress:** 4/68 stories complete (6% - all infrastructure/setup)
  - ✅ 1.1: Next.js initialized
  - ✅ 1.2: Firebase configured (security rules fixed)
  - ✅ 1.5: Vercel deployed to slacklite.app
  - ✅ 1.6: Design system foundation (in review)
- **Active subagents:** 0 currently
- **PL session:** agent:project-lead:project-slacklite (alive but idle)
- **Last activity:** ~10 min ago - PL spawned Amelia to complete Firebase setup + Vercel env configuration
  - Amelia finished Firebase project creation, added 7 env vars to Vercel, fixed ESLint errors
  - Vercel redeploy was in progress
  - Known issue: Firebase RTDB requires manual Blaze plan or console setup

**Current state:** Project is in very early stages. PL session is idle after Amelia's task completion - likely waiting for:
1. User QA of deployment
2. Manual Firebase RTDB setup
3. Next story batch pickup

**No action taken** - this was a status check only

## 09:41-09:46 CST - SlackLite Flow Stopped: PL Autonomy Issue

**Problem reported:** User noticed flow had stopped - no progress for ~23 minutes

**Root cause identified:**
- PL spawned Amelia (Firebase + Vercel config) ✅
- Amelia completed but found blockers (401 errors, RTDB needs manual setup) ✅
- **PL asked: "Want me to spawn Amelia to investigate the 401 issue and create the RTDB instance manually?"** ❌
- PL waited 23 minutes for user response instead of working autonomously

**Lesson learned:** Project Lead should work autonomously through technical blockers, not ask permission at every step.

**What PL should have done:**
- Immediately spawn Amelia with YOLO MODE to fix 401 + create RTDB
- Report back when resolved OR when hitting hard blocker (payment required)

**False alarm: Billing error message**
- User received "API provider returned billing error" message at 09:44
- Investigation: All billing errors found were from YESTERDAY (Feb 17-18) - Research Lead CIS agents hit API limits
- Currently active Amelia session has NO billing errors - working normally
- Source of error message unclear (possibly stale notification or from different context)

**Action taken:**
- Sent "work autonomously" directive to PL session
- Instructed: Don't wait for permission, spawn subagents to fix blockers, only escalate hard blockers (payment/billing)
- PL spawned Amelia autonomously to fix 401 + RTDB issues

**Architecture gap identified:**
- **Missing:** Project Lead AGENTS.md with autonomy policy
- **Exists:** Core docs (`docs/core/project-lead-flow.md`) specify YOLO MODE for **subagent spawns** but not for **PL's own decision-making**
- **Need:** Explicit instructions for PL to work autonomously through technical blockers

**User question:** Should we create PL AGENTS.md and update core docs with autonomy policy?

**Proposed fixes:**
1. **Create `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/agents/project-lead/AGENTS.md`**
   - Core principle: Work autonomously through technical blockers
   - When to ask: Only scope changes or hard blockers (payment/approval needed)
   - When NOT to ask: Technical issues, config problems, deployment failures

2. **Update `docs/core/project-lead-flow.md`**
   - Add "Autonomy Policy" section
   - Specify: PL spawns subagents autonomously for all technical work
   - Only escalate: Scope changes, payment decisions, external approvals

3. **Kelly heartbeat enhancement**
   - Currently: Stall check triggers at 60+ min
   - Could add: Auto-respond "work autonomously" if PL asks permission for technical work

**Waiting on:** User decision on implementing these documentation changes


## 09:48 CST - Model Upgrade: Sonnet 4-6 System-Wide

**Change:** Upgraded default model from Sonnet 4-5 to Sonnet 4-6 across all agents and coding CLIs.

**What changed:**
1. **Gateway config** (`agents.defaults.model.primary`): `claude-sonnet-4-5` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`
2. **Coding CLI wrapper** (`coding-cli/bin/code-with-fallback`): Added `--model sonnet` flag to Claude Code calls (Tier 1 & 2)
3. **Fallback cascade order updated:**
   - Tier 1: Claude Code Sonnet 4-6 + Anthropic plan (PRIMARY)
   - Tier 2: Claude Code Sonnet 4-6 + API key
   - Tier 3: Codex gpt-5.3-codex + GPT plan
   - Tier 4: Codex gpt-5.3-codex + API key
4. **Codex unchanged:** Still using `gpt-5.3-codex` (NOT Spark) from `~/.codex/config.toml` - correct for thorough implementation work

**Impact:**
- All agents (Kelly, Project Lead, Research Lead, BMAD agents) now use Sonnet 4-6 by default
- Amelia, Barry, Murat coding workflows use Sonnet 4-6 first, fall back to Codex on errors
- Gateway restarted automatically via SIGUSR1

**Files updated:**
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (gateway config)
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/factory/build/coding-cli/bin/code-with-fallback` (wrapper script)
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/factory/build/coding-cli/SKILL.md` (documentation)
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/factory/test/murat-testing/SKILL.md` (documentation)

## 10:02 CST - Sonnet 4-6 Revert (Model Not Recognized)

**Issue:** User reported Sonnet 4-6 upgrade broke system - Project Lead sessions failing with "Unknown model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"

**Root cause:**
- OpenClaw's model registry doesn't recognize `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` yet
- Gateway log showed: `Error: Unknown model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Model either doesn't exist or OpenClaw needs version update to support it

**Fix applied:**
- Reverted gateway config: `claude-sonnet-4-5` (back to original)
- Removed `--model sonnet` flags from Claude Code wrapper
- Updated documentation back to generic "Claude Code" (no version specified)
- Gateway restarted via SIGUSR1

**Files reverted:**
- `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (gateway config)
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/factory/build/coding-cli/bin/code-with-fallback` (wrapper)
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/factory/build/coding-cli/SKILL.md` (docs)
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/factory/test/murat-testing/SKILL.md` (docs)

**Lesson:** Always test model availability before system-wide upgrade - OpenClaw's model registry must recognize the model string first.

## 10:48-10:52 CST - Dashboard Fixed + SlackLite Restarted

**Dashboard restoration complete:**
1. **Problem:** Gateway API `sessions_list` tool was broken (stale session index)
2. **Solution:** Rewrote `/api/sessions` to call `openclaw sessions --json` directly
3. **Added:** Proper data mapping (CLI JSON → frontend format)
4. **Fixed:** Null-safety operators for `.includes()` calls throughout components
5. **Result:** Dashboard now shows active sessions correctly

**File changes:**
- `kelly-dashboard/app/api/sessions/route.ts` - Uses CLI instead of Gateway API
- `kelly-dashboard/components/factory-view/active-project-leads.tsx` - Added `?.` operators
- `kelly-dashboard/components/factory-view/agent-list.tsx` - Added `?.` operators
- `kelly-dashboard/components/project-view/project-header.tsx` - Added `?.` operators

**SlackLite restart:**
- Closed 2 ghost Project Lead sessions (from morning recovery)
- Spawned new PL session via `openclaw gateway call agent` (runId: DA76430D...)
- Session hasn't appeared in CLI yet (may still be initializing or failed)

**Dashboard status:**
- URL: http://localhost:3000
- Shows: 2 active sessions (both main)
- Working: API + UI rendering
- Missing: SlackLite PL session (needs investigation)

## 10:53-11:01 CST - Dashboard Fully Restored (File-Based Session Detection)

**Final fix for dashboard session detection:**

**Root cause:** OpenClaw's session index files (`sessions.json`) were systemically corrupted:
- All agents except `main` had `key: null` in their indexes
- Gateway API `sessions_list` and CLI both rely on these indexes
- Result: 12 active `.jsonl` session files existed but weren't being detected

**Solution:** Rewrote dashboard API to bypass broken indexes entirely:
- Scans `/Users/austenallred/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/*.jsonl` files directly
- Filters by file modification time (mtime) instead of index timestamps
- Skips files with "deleted", "closed", or "frozen" in filename
- Reconstructs session keys from agent name + sessionId
- Maps to project IDs via registry lookup

**Dashboard now shows:**
- 15 active sessions (was showing 0-3)
- 5 Amelia (bmad-bmm-amelia)
- 2 Research Lead sessions
- 2 Main sessions (webchat + Matrix)
- 1 Project Lead session
- 1 Mary + 4 CIS agents (Carson, Maya, Quinn, Victor)

**File changes:**
- `kelly-dashboard/app/api/sessions/route.ts` - Complete rewrite to scan files directly
- Added DEBUG logging to trace session discovery
- Removed dependency on Gateway API and CLI (both rely on broken indexes)

**Status:**
- ✅ Dashboard fully operational at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ All active sessions visible
- ✅ Research sessions showing
- ✅ Project sessions showing
- ⚠️ OpenClaw session indexing bug needs to be reported upstream

**Known issue:** SlackLite Project Lead session was active 10:04-10:32 (Amelia disabled Vercel protection) but session disappeared from index. This is a symptom of the broader session indexing corruption problem.

## 11:04-11:11 CST - SlackLite Project Lead Restarted + Active Development

**SlackLite restoration complete:**

**Actions taken:**
1. Killed 2 orphaned Project Lead sessions (81d7f501, f642be3d) - archived with .deleted timestamps
2. Spawned fresh SlackLite PL session: `agent:project-lead:81d7f501`
3. Updated project registry: `slacklite.implementation.plSession` = `"agent:project-lead:81d7f501"` (was: `"agent:project-lead:project-slacklite"`)
4. Registry cache cleared, API now correctly returns `projectId: "slacklite"`

**SlackLite current status (11:10 AM):**
- **Progress:** 6/68 stories complete (9%)
- **Project Lead:** Active, spawned Wave 3 dev stories
- **Active subagents:** 5 Amelia sessions working concurrently
  - Story 2.1: Create Landing Page
  - Story 2.2: Build Sign Up Form UI
  - Story 2.4: Build Sign In Form with Firebase Auth
  - Story 2.5: Create Auth Context Provider
  - Story 4.1: Create Message Data Models
- **Queued:** 5 more stories ready for next wave (6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 11.3)

**Coding CLI cascade status:**
- Tier 1: Claude Code (Anthropic plan) - Rate limited ❌
- Tier 2: Claude Code (API key) - Rate limited ❌
- Tier 3: Codex (GPT plan) - **Currently active** ✅
- Tier 4: Codex (API key) - Standby

**Observation:** Claude Code hit rate limits quickly, system fell back to Codex (Tier 3) as designed. All 5 Amelias using Codex for implementation. Cascade working correctly.

**Dashboard status:**
- ✅ Showing 1 active project (SlackLite) with correct title
- ✅ All 15 sessions visible across agents
- ✅ File-based session detection working (bypasses broken indexes)
- ✅ Project card shows "SlackLite" (not "Unknown Project")

**Waiting on:**
- Amelias to complete current stories (~5-10 min per story)
- Auto-announce completion back to Project Lead
- Project Lead to spawn next wave automatically

## 11:11-11:13 CST - Claude Code Authentication Issue Identified

**Root cause of Codex fallback discovered:**

**Problem:** Claude Code is using API key instead of Anthropic subscription
- `claude auth status` shows:
  - ✅ `loggedIn: true`
  - ❌ `subscriptionType: null` (no subscription detected)
  - ⚠️ `apiKeySource: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"` (using API key with tight limits)
  - ❌ `authMethod: "claude.ai"` but no org/subscription linked

**Impact:**
- Claude Code (Tier 1 & 2) hitting API key rate limits immediately
- Instant fallback to Codex (Tier 3) for all coding work
- All 5 SlackLite Amelias currently using Codex instead of Claude Code

**Solution required:**
- Run `claude auth login` to trigger OAuth flow
- Authenticate with Anthropic account (Pro/Max subscription)
- URL: https://claude.ai/oauth/authorize?code=true&client_id=9d1c250a-e61b-44d9-88ed-5944d1962f5e...
- After auth, `subscriptionType` should show "pro" or "max"
- This will restore Tier 1 (Claude Code with subscription) to full capacity

**Waiting on:**
- User to complete OAuth authentication flow
- Once fixed: Claude Code will be primary again, Codex only as true fallback

## 11:13-11:16 CST - Claude Code OAuth Authentication Attempt

**Action taken:**
- Attempted to automate Claude Code OAuth login via web-browser skill
- Successfully opened OAuth URL in persistent Chrome profile:
  - `https://claude.ai/oauth/authorize?code=true&client_id=9d1c250a-e61b-44d9-88ed-5944d1962f5e...`
- Browser automation hit port conflict (18792 EADDRINUSE)
- Could not automate the "Authorize" button click

**Fallback:**
- OAuth page IS open in user's browser
- User can complete authentication manually with one click
- After auth completes: `claude auth status` should show `subscriptionType: "pro"` or `"max"`

**Expected result after auth:**
- Claude Code will use Anthropic subscription instead of API key
- Tier 1 & 2 will have much higher rate limits
- Less immediate fallback to Codex
- Factory will run faster and cheaper

**Current SlackLite status:**
- 5 Amelia subagents still active, working on stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 4.1
- All using Codex (Tier 3) due to Claude Code API key rate limits
- Waiting on user to complete OAuth auth to restore Claude Code primary tier

## 11:16-11:21 CST - Claude Code OAuth Automation via Playwright

**Successful automation:**
- User suggested: "Can't you copy that URL and paste it into a playwright instance?"
- ✅ Used Playwright to connect to Chrome CDP (port 18800)
- ✅ Navigated to OAuth authorization URL automatically
- ✅ Found and clicked "Authorize" button programmatically (twice - once for logout/reauth)
- ✅ OAuth callback received successfully with authorization codes

**Script used:**
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP('http://127.0.0.1:18800');
// Navigate to OAuth URL, click authorize button, wait for redirect
```

**Result:**
- ❌ `claude auth status` still shows `subscriptionType: null`
- ℹ️ Still using `authMethod: "api_key"` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- ❌ No subscription detected despite successful OAuth flow

**Possible reasons:**
1. Account may not have Anthropic Pro/Max subscription active
2. OAuth scopes may not include subscription access
3. Claude Code may need additional configuration to use subscription credits

**Impact:**
- Claude Code Tier 1 & 2 continue using API key limits (not subscription)
- System continues falling back to Codex (Tier 3) - working as designed
- Current behavior: functional but not optimal

**Status:**
- SlackLite still progressing with 5 Amelia subagents using Codex
- Factory operational, just using fallback tier instead of primary

## 11:21 CST - Research Lead Output Format Update

**User request:** Update Research Lead output format
- Change filename from `intake.md` to `{ProductName}-PRD.md`
- Add Executive Summary section at top with Title, Description, Pain Point

**Changes made:**
1. Updated `docs/core/research-lead-flow.md` v3.3:
   - Phase 5 renamed from "Create intake.md" to "Create PRD"
   - New filename format: `{product-name}-PRD.md` (e.g., `Hindsight-PRD.md`)
   - Added Executive Summary template with Title, Description, Pain Point
   - Updated "Next Steps" text (PRD instead of intake)

2. Updated Research Lead AGENTS.md:
   - Updated Phase 6 Step 2 with new PRD format instructions
   - Added Executive Summary format specification
   - Updated Step 4 announcement message to reference PRD path

3. Applied format to existing output:
   - Updated `/Users/austenallred/Sync/Car-Maintenance-Tracker-PRD.md`
   - Added Executive Summary section with Hindsight details

**Committed:**
- feat: Research Lead output format update - PRD with Executive Summary (682d69c)
- Pushed to origin/dev

**Result:** Future Research Lead runs will output properly formatted PRDs with executive summaries at top.

## 11:21-11:25 CST - Claude Code OAuth Root Cause: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Priority

**Discovery:**
- User question: "Did you oauth with the kelly@bloomtech.com email?"
- ✅ Re-authenticated with `claude auth login --email kelly@bloomtech.com`
- ✅ Playwright successfully clicked Authorize button with kelly@ account
- ✅ OAuth callback completed: received authorization code
- ❌ `claude auth status` still shows `subscriptionType: null`

**Root cause identified:**
- Claude Code prioritizes environment variable over OAuth credentials
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in environment (`sk-ant-api03-cu8HY1h-NxICvL-qQ...`)
- `claude auth status` shows: `apiKeySource: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`
- OAuth credentials are successfully stored but **ignored** due to env var

**Priority order in Claude Code:**
1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable ← **Currently using**
2. OAuth credentials (kelly@bloomtech.com) ← **Successfully set but ignored**

**Solution (not yet applied):**
- `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` would force Claude Code to use OAuth subscription
- Risk: May break other tools/scripts depending on this env var

**Current status:**
- Factory operational with Codex fallback (Tier 3)
- SlackLite progressing with 5 Amelia subagents
- OAuth authentication successful but not active
- Waiting on user decision: unset API key vs continue with Codex

## 11:25-11:27 CST - Claude Code OAuth Priority Investigation

**User question:** "We can't change the order of that prio?"

**Attempted solution:**
- Modified `code-with-fallback` to temporarily unset `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Tier 1
- Goal: Force Claude Code to use OAuth credentials instead of API key
- Tested but OAuth credentials show `loggedIn: false` when API key is unset

**Root problem:**
- OAuth credentials don't persist properly when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exists in environment
- Claude Code prioritizes env var and doesn't save OAuth tokens when API key is present
- Unsetting API key shows `loggedIn: false` (OAuth session didn't actually save)

**Conclusion:**
- Cannot easily change priority order without fully removing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from shell environment
- Reverted code-with-fallback changes (back to original cascade)
- Current Codex fallback (Tier 3) is working fine for SlackLite
- Factory operational, not worth breaking other tools that depend on ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

**Recommendation:** Keep current setup (API key + Codex fallback) - it's working.

## 11:27-11:29 CST - Claude Code OAuth Final Decision

**Decision made:** Keep current setup with Codex fallback

**Rationale:**
- Cannot change priority order without permanently removing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from environment
- OAuth credentials don't persist when API key env var exists
- Removing API key could break other tools/scripts
- Current Codex fallback (Tier 3) is fully operational
- SlackLite progressing successfully with 5 Amelia subagents using Codex

**Final status:**
- Reverted all changes to `code-with-fallback`
- Cascade remains: Claude Code (Tier 1-2 with API key) → Codex (Tier 3) → Codex API (Tier 4)
- Factory operational and productive
- No action needed - continuing SlackLite development as-is

## 11:45-11:53 CST - Project Lead Stall Diagnosis + Heartbeat Fix

**Issue:** SlackLite PL stopped responding at 11:14 AM after acknowledging 5 Amelia completions

**Root Cause Found:**
- PL's last message (11:14:42): "All 5 Wave 3 stories complete! Ready to spawn the queued 5 stories (6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 11.3)."
- Then NEVER spawned them - session completely stopped
- The "60-second continuous loop" described in docs is NOT running autonomously
- PL appears to be event-driven, not truly autonomous polling

**Why heartbeats didn't catch it:**
1. **Kelly's heartbeat:** 60-minute threshold too long for active projects
   - SlackLite registry updated 14 minutes ago (something external updated it at 11:32)
   - Won't trigger check until 12:32 PM (46 more minutes)
   - By then, 78 minutes wasted
2. **PL's heartbeat:** Doesn't exist - PL is event-driven, waits for external triggers
   - Should have 60s autonomous loop checking sprint-status.yaml
   - Loop not implemented or broken

**Fix applied:**
- Updated `HEARTBEAT.md`: Changed threshold from 60 minutes → **20 minutes**
- Rationale: Subagents complete in 5-15min, PL should spawn next wave in 5min
- 20min = missed multiple 60s polling cycles = definite stall
- Prevents wasting 45+ minutes when PL freezes

**Immediate action:**
- Pinged PL session (runId: 75A98558) - waiting for response
- If PL doesn't wake up, will need session recovery

**Critical bug:** Project Lead's "continuous loop" is not actually continuous/autonomous.

## 11:53-11:58 CST - Root Cause: Gateway Heartbeat System Not Executing

**User question:** "Project Lead's self ping, isn't that heartbeat?"

**Answer:** YES! The 60s continuous loop described in docs IS Project Lead's heartbeat mechanism.

**Configuration verified:**
```json
"project-lead": {
  "heartbeat": {
    "every": "60s",
    "target": "none"  // Self-ping (no external target)
  }
}
```

**Critical finding:** Gateway heartbeat scheduler is NOT executing PL heartbeats
- Checked Gateway logs: NO heartbeat activity for SlackLite PL session since creation (11:05 AM)
- Last project-lead heartbeat log entry: Feb 17 (2 days ago)
- Config says "fire every 60s" but Gateway isn't doing it
- This is a **Gateway-level bug**, not a Project Lead implementation bug

**Why PL stopped at 11:14 AM:**
- PL received 5 completion announcements (11:10-11:14 AM)
- PL acknowledged: "Ready to spawn the queued 5 stories (6.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 11.3)"
- Then stopped - waiting for next heartbeat to trigger polling loop
- Heartbeat never fired because Gateway scheduler isn't running them
- PL has been idle for 44 minutes waiting for a heartbeat that will never come

**Confirmation:**
- PL has `every: "60s"` configured
- Gateway logs show zero heartbeat executions for this session
- Other agents (main, research-lead) also have heartbeat configs
- This appears to be systemic Gateway heartbeat failure

**Workaround needed:**
- Kelly's updated 20-minute threshold will catch stalls faster
- But doesn't fix root cause: PL needs autonomous 60s polling
- May need Kelly to manually ping PL every 20 minutes as temporary fix

**Status:**
- PL ping sent at 11:46 AM (runId: 75A98558) - no response yet (12 min ago)
- 5 Amelias completed 34-48 minutes ago
- Next wave (5 stories) waiting to be spawned
- Dashboard fixed to show all sessions/subagents correctly

## 12:38 CST - Manus Research Integration Design

**User request:** Design Manus integration as idea factory for software factory backlog generation

**Research done:**
- Searched Manus documentation (manus.im, open.manus.im)
- Found Manus has REST API + community MCP server (gianlucamazza/mcp-manus-server)
- Confirmed MCP integration is more robust than direct REST API

**Design decisions:**
1. **Architecture:** Kelly → MCP → Manus API (cloud execution)
2. **Purpose:** High-volume discovery (10-15 ideas per 5-10 min run)
3. **Scope:** Crowded markets OK if execution advantage exists (vs Research Lead's novelty-first)
4. **Integration:** Manus for breadth, Research Lead for depth

**Created:** `docs/core/manus-research-integration.md` (607 lines)

**Key sections:**
- Architecture + communication flow
- User workflow (request → discovery → validation → PRD)
- Config schema for Kelly to pass to Manus
- Prompt template for idea discovery
- Output format (12 problems with evidence + competitive landscape)
- Integration with Research Lead v3.3 (hybrid workflow)
- Error handling + security considerations

**Next steps (implementation):**
1. Deploy mcp-manus-server locally (Docker)
2. Get Manus API key (open.manus.im)
3. Configure OpenClaw to connect to MCP server
4. Update Kelly's AGENTS.md with Manus commands
5. Test discovery flow end-to-end

**Status:** Design complete, pending MCP server deployment

**Committed:** 2130d07 - feat: Add Manus research integration core doc

## 12:10-12:21 CST - Gateway Heartbeat Bug Root Cause + Kelly Workaround Implemented

**Issue:** Gateway heartbeats only fire for `:main` sessions, not custom session keys like `agent:project-lead:project-slacklite`

**Root cause discovered:**
- Gateway scheduler reads `agents.list[].heartbeat` config
- Hardcoded to send heartbeats ONLY to `agent:{agentId}:main`
- Custom sessions (`agent:project-lead:project-slacklite`) never receive heartbeats
- This is why SlackLite PL stopped at 11:14 AM - waiting for heartbeat that never came

**Evidence from sessions.json:**
- `agent:project-lead:main`: Has heartbeat origin, updated 20 min ago ✅
- `agent:project-lead:project-slacklite`: NO heartbeat origin, only receives webchat messages ❌

**Fix applied - Kelly Heartbeat Proxy:**
1. Updated Kelly's heartbeat interval: 60 minutes → **60 seconds**
2. Added PL session heartbeat distribution to `HEARTBEAT.md`:
   - Every 60s, Kelly scans `~/.openclaw/agents/project-lead/sessions/sessions.json`
   - Finds all `agent:project-lead:project-*` sessions
   - Filters for recently active (updated in last 60 minutes)
   - Sends `sessions_send(sessionKey, "HEARTBEAT_POLL")` to each

**Why this works:**
- Kelly's heartbeat DOES fire (it's the `:main` session)
- Kelly becomes heartbeat distributor for all PL sessions
- PL sessions wake every 60s, check sprint-status, spawn next wave
- No source code changes needed (avoids breaking with OpenClaw updates)

**Files changed:**
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`: `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: "60s"`
- `/Users/austenallred/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md`: Added section 1 (PL session heartbeat distribution)

**Trade-offs:**
- Kelly wakes every 60s (more token cost) but necessary for PL autonomy
- Centralized via Kelly (single point of failure) but simpler than per-project cron jobs
- Workaround until Gateway core supports heartbeats for all sessions of an agent

**Status:**
- Gateway restarted successfully via SIGUSR1
- Kelly will start distributing PL heartbeats on next cycle (60s from restart)
- SlackLite PL should wake up and spawn next wave within 2 minutes

**Proper fix (future):** Gateway scheduler should discover all active sessions per agent and send heartbeats to each, not just `:main`. Requires OpenClaw core changes.

## 12:58 CST - Manus REST API Integration Complete

**Context:** MCP server (gianlucamazza/mcp-manus-server) had broken dependencies (k6, opentelemetry-auto packages missing). Decided to skip MCP and build REST API integration instead.

**API Key Stored:**
- Added to ~/.zshrc: `export MANUS_API_KEY="sk-13H...ydj"`
- Verified accessible in shell

**Created:**  `skills/manus-api/` with 3 files:
1. **bin/create-task** - Trigger Manus tasks
   - Usage: `--prompt "..." --profile manus-1.6`
   - Returns task_id, task_url
   
2. **bin/get-task** - Check status/retrieve results
   - Usage: `--id <task_id>`
   - Shows status, output, credits used
   
3. **SKILL.md** - Documentation
   - API reference
   - Kelly integration guide  
   - Prompt template for product discovery
   - Error handling

**Tested Successfully:**
- Created test task: `SqP8t2QbhihQysHBskDUAH`
- Prompt: "List 3 simple iOS app ideas for productivity"
- Status: completed
- Output: 3 app ideas (Focus Timer, Quick Capture Notes, Daily Habit Streaks)
- Credits used: 6
- Output saved to: `manus-task-SqP8t2QbhihQysHBskDUAH-output.txt`

**Fixed Bug:**
- GET endpoint was /v1/tasks/{task_id} (path param), not /v1/tasks?task_id=... (query param)
- Updated get-task script to use correct endpoint format

**Next Steps:**
- Kelly can now trigger Manus for product discovery
- Build discovery prompt formatter in Kelly's AGENTS.md
- Test full discovery workflow (10-15 ideas)
- Integrate with Research Lead v3.3 (Manus → Quinn → Research Lead → PRD)

**Committed:** bd1f38a - feat: Add Manus REST API skill

**Status:** REST API integration complete and tested! 🚀

## 14:00-14:10 CST - Heartbeat System Fixed with Cron Jobs

**Root cause of heartbeat failures (FULL DIAGNOSIS):**

1. Gateway heartbeats were disabled at runtime (`openclaw system heartbeat last` returned null)
2. `openclaw system heartbeat enable` re-enabled them
3. BUT heartbeats get SKIPPED when main queue is busy (active conversation blocks heartbeat)
4. Docs confirm: "If the main queue is busy, the heartbeat is skipped and retried later"
5. HEARTBEAT.md being empty (only headers) causes heartbeats to be skipped entirely
6. `target: "none"` was NOT the issue (docs confirm it still runs, just no delivery)

**Solution: Cron job replaces Gateway heartbeat for PL distribution**

Created cron job `21ceac12-42cc-4bec-afd0-74678dfbc4ea` ("PL Session Heartbeat Distributor"):
- Runs every 60 seconds in ISOLATED session (not blocked by main queue!)
- Reads PL sessions.json, finds active project sessions
- Sends `sessions_send("HEARTBEAT_POLL")` to each active PL session
- Delivery: none (no spam to main session)
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5

**Why cron > heartbeat for this use case:**
- Cron runs in isolated sessions → NOT blocked by active conversations
- Cron scheduler is reliable (proven working, unlike heartbeat scheduler)
- Independent of HEARTBEAT.md existence/content
- Each run takes ~28 seconds, fires reliably every 60s

**Config changes:**
- Removed `agents.list[].heartbeat` for main agent (using cron instead)
- Kept `tools.sessions.visibility: "all"` for cross-agent messaging
- Created PL HEARTBEAT.md at `~/.openclaw/workspaces/project-lead/HEARTBEAT.md`

**Architecture:**
```
Cron (every 60s, isolated session)
  → Scans PL sessions.json
  → sessions_send("HEARTBEAT_POLL") to each active PL session
  → PL wakes up, reads its HEARTBEAT.md
  → PL checks sprint-status, health-checks subagents, spawns next wave
```

**Verified working:** Two consecutive cron runs completed successfully, PL session updated each time.

## 14:12 CST - Manus idea-factory Skill Integration

**Discovery:** Manus has a custom `idea-factory` skill built for our workflow!

**Skill Config Options:**
```yaml
platform: "iOS" | "web" | "Android"
complexity: "very_simple" | "simple" | "moderate" | "complex"
pricing_model: "freemium" | "paid" | "subscription"
avoid_pain_points: ["domain-1", "domain-2", ...] # Previously researched
```

**Key Changes from Previous Approach:**

**Before (raw prompts):**
- Kelly constructs massive 5000-word discovery workflow prompt
- Manus executes generic task
- Expected: 10-15 quick ideas in 5-10 min

**After (idea-factory skill):**
- Kelly invokes skill: `Run idea-factory skill with platform=iOS, complexity=simple, pricing_model=freemium, avoid=[...]`
- Manus executes saved, optimized discovery workflow
- Timeline: 2-3 hours per idea (deep research)
- Output: 1 fully-researched Product Brief per run

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simpler Kelly integration (just pass config, not full workflow)
- ✅ Manus maintains workflow logic (separation of concerns)
- ✅ Deeper research quality (2-3 hour workflow vs. quick batch)
- ✅ Repeatable/versioned (skill is saved in Manus)

**Trade-off:**
- ❌ 1 idea per 2-3 hours (not 10-15 in 5-10 min)
- ✅ But higher quality, better researched

**For batch generation:**
Run skill multiple times in parallel with different configs

**Updated Docs:**
- `manus-research-integration.md` - New config schema, skill invocation format
- `manus-api/SKILL.md` - Example invocations, config reference

**Committed:** 464b46e - feat: Update Manus integration to use idea-factory skill

**Next:** Kelly can now trigger idea-factory skill with simple prompts!

## 14:02-14:24 CST - Heartbeat System Final Fix + PL Restart

### Heartbeat Root Cause (FINAL DIAGNOSIS)

After extensive debugging, identified ALL issues with Gateway heartbeat system:

1. **Gateway heartbeats skip when main queue is busy** (active conversation blocks heartbeat)
   - Docs confirm: "If the main queue is busy, the heartbeat is skipped and retried later"
   - This means heartbeats are unreliable during active user chats

2. **HEARTBEAT.md being empty/headers-only causes heartbeats to be skipped entirely**
   - Docs: "If HEARTBEAT.md exists but is effectively empty (only blank lines and markdown headers), OpenClaw skips the heartbeat run"

3. **`target: "none"` is correct** - docs confirm it still runs, just no external delivery

4. **If ANY agent has `heartbeat` block, ONLY those agents get heartbeats**
   - We had PL and RL with heartbeat blocks but not main → main never got heartbeats

5. **Heartbeats only fire to `:main` session** - no way to target custom session keys like `project-slacklite`

6. **`session: "main"` explicitly set BROKE the scheduler** - removing it fixed firing

### Solution: Cron Job Replaces Gateway Heartbeat

**Created cron job** `21ceac12-42cc-4bec-afd0-74678dfbc4ea` ("PL Session Heartbeat Distributor"):
- Runs every 60s in ISOLATED session (not blocked by main queue!)
- Reads `~/.openclaw/agents/project-lead/sessions/sessions.json`
- Finds all `agent:project-lead:project-*` sessions active in last 60 min
- Sends full heartbeat prompt via `sessions_send` to each PL session
- Message includes "Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists..." (standard heartbeat prompt)
- Delivery: none (no spam to main session)
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5

**Why cron > heartbeat for this use case:**
- Cron runs in isolated sessions → NOT blocked by active conversations
- Cron scheduler is proven reliable (multiple consecutive successful runs verified)
- Independent of HEARTBEAT.md existence/content in Kelly's workspace
- Each run takes ~28-30 seconds, fires reliably every 60s

### Config Changes
- Removed ALL `agents.list[].heartbeat` blocks (using cron instead)
- Removed `agents.defaults.heartbeat` (using cron instead)  
- Kept `tools.sessions.visibility: "all"` for cross-agent messaging
- Created PL HEARTBEAT.md at `~/.openclaw/workspaces/project-lead/HEARTBEAT.md`

### Architecture
```
Cron (every 60s, isolated session)
  → Reads PL sessions.json
  → sessions_send("Read HEARTBEAT.md...") to each active PL session
  → PL wakes up, reads HEARTBEAT.md
  → PL checks sprint-status, health-checks subagents, spawns next wave
```

### PL HEARTBEAT.md (Updated)
Key additions:
- **Step 3: Kill Duplicates (CRITICAL)** - #1 cause of wasted compute
- **Step 5: Duplicate check before spawning** - verify story not already in-progress
- Explicit instructions to NOT just reply HEARTBEAT_OK without checking

### PL Session Restart (14:15 CST)
- Killed old PL session (81d7f501) + 5 Amelia subagents
- Spawned fresh PL session (66fe85e5) for SlackLite
- Fresh PL read sprint-status, found 17/68 done, spawned first wave
- PL picked up right where old one left off
- Progress: 17 → 20 done within 10 minutes

### Dashboard Bug Identified
- Dashboard shows 10 "active" subagents when only 2 have `.lock` files
- Root cause: Dashboard reads recent session files (by mtime) not lock files
- Shows completed/dead sessions as "active"
- Need to fix `/api/active-subagents` to check `.lock` files only
- Real state: 2 active Amelias (3.4, 4.2), 20/68 done

### Current State (14:24 CST)
- **SlackLite:** 20/68 done (29%), 2 in-progress, 51 todo
- **Active Amelias:** 2 (Stories 3.4, 4.2)
- **PL Session:** agent:project-lead:project-slacklite (66fe85e5) - fresh, healthy
- **Cron job:** Firing every 60s, PL responding to heartbeats
- **Next:** PL should spawn 3 more Amelias on next heartbeat to fill 5 slots

## 14:31 CST - Manus idea-factory Config Update

**User provided updated config with new parameter:**

```yaml
platform: "iOS"
complexity: "moderate"
novelty_level: "high"  # NEW PARAMETER
pricing_model: "subscription"

**Updated Files:**
- `docs/core/manus-research-integration.md` - Config schema, examples
- `skills/manus-api/SKILL.md` - Config options reference, example invocation

**Example Invocation (Updated):**
```bash
/Users/austenallred/clawd/skills/manus-api/bin/create-task \
  --prompt "Run idea-factory skill with platform=iOS, complexity=moderate, novelty_level=high, pricing_model=subscription, avoid=[fasting tracking, water intake tracking, caffeine intake tracking, parking location tracking, ADHD navigation, home maintenance tracking, finance categorization]" \
  --profile manus-1.6
```

**Committed:** 3f594fd - feat: Add novelty_level parameter to Manus idea-factory config

## 14:24-14:32 CST - Dashboard Fixed (Lock-Based Active Detection + Sprint Stats)

### Active Subagents Fix
**Problem:** Dashboard showed 10 "active" subagents when only 2-4 had `.lock` files (completed sessions shown as active)
**Root cause:** `/api/active-subagents` used `updatedAt` from sessions.json index — recently completed sessions still had recent timestamps
**Fix:** Rewrote to scan for `.lock` files only — only sessions with active locks are truly running
- Reads first 4KB of session file to extract story number and project match
- Falls back to session index for label matching
- No more ghost/duplicate sessions

### Sprint Stats Fix  
**Problem:** "Completed subagents" count showed 0 — project-state API wasn't parsing sprint-status.yaml correctly
**Root cause:** sprint-status.yaml uses nested objects (`stories: { "1.1": { status: "done" } }`) not arrays
- Old code checked `Array.isArray(sprintStatus.stories)` which was always false
- Stats computation never ran

**Fix:** Updated project-state API to handle object-format stories:
- `Object.entries(sprintStatus.stories)` instead of array iteration
- Stats now correctly count done/in_progress/todo from sprint-status.yaml
- Also counts "review" status as "done" (review = code complete)

### Files Changed
- `projects/kelly-dashboard/app/api/active-subagents/route.ts` - Complete rewrite: lock-file based detection
- `projects/kelly-dashboard/app/api/project-state/route.ts` - Fixed sprint-status YAML parsing (object not array)
- `projects/kelly-dashboard/app/project/[id]/page.tsx` - Use `stats.done`/`stats.total` from sprint-status, added `stats` to ProjectState type, added `sessionId` to Session type
- `projects/kelly-dashboard/components/factory-view/active-project-leads.tsx` - Added `sessionId` to Session type, fixed optional chaining

### Verified Results
- Active subagents: 4 unique stories, no duplicates ✅
- Sprint stats: 24/74 done (32%), 2 in-progress, 46 todo ✅
- Dashboard rebuilt and restarted on port 3000 ✅

### SlackLite Current State (14:32 CST)
- **Progress:** 24/74 done (32%)
- **Active Amelias:** 4 (Stories 3.3, 3.6, 3.9, 5.1)
- **PL Session:** agent:project-lead:project-slacklite (66fe85e5) - fresh, healthy
- **Cron heartbeat:** Running every 60s, PL responding and spawning waves
- **Factory moving autonomously** — no manual intervention needed

## 14:32-14:37 CST - Dashboard: Session Logs in Cards + Completed Subagents

### Session Logs in SubagentCard (NEW)
**User request:** "I'd like to be able to see the session logs within a Session Card"

**Implementation:**
1. Created `/api/session-logs` endpoint - fetches transcript messages for any session key
   - Parses JSONL transcripts, extracts role/text/toolName/timestamp
   - Supports subagent, project-lead, and other session key formats
   - Returns last N messages (default 30)

2. Added `SessionLogs` component to `SubagentCard`
   - Expandable ▶ Session Logs toggle at bottom of each card
   - Shows last 30 messages with role icons (👤 user, 🤖 assistant, 🔧 tool, 📋 system)
   - Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds when expanded (for active sessions)
   - Auto-scrolls to bottom on new messages
   - Truncates long messages to 200 chars
   - Max height 264px with scroll overflow
   - Clicking toggle doesn't navigate away (uses data-logs-toggle to prevent card click)

### Completed Subagents Fix
**Problem:** Dashboard showed 0 completed subagents even though 27 stories were done
**Root cause:** `project-state` API only generated synthetic subagents from planning artifacts, not from sprint-status stories
**Fix:** Generate completed subagent entries from sprint-status stories with `status: done` or `status: review`
- Each done story becomes a subagent entry with story title, persona (from `completed_by` field), timestamps
- Result: 27 completed subagents now showing correctly

### Files Changed
- `app/api/session-logs/route.ts` - NEW: API endpoint for fetching session transcript messages
- `app/api/project-state/route.ts` - Generate completed subagent entries from sprint-status done stories
- `components/project-view/subagent-card.tsx` - Added expandable SessionLogs component, fixed click handling

### Current State (14:37 CST)
- **SlackLite:** 27/74 done (36%), 4 in-progress, 41 todo
- **Dashboard:** Fully operational with session logs + completed subagents
- **Cron heartbeat:** Running every 60s, PL spawning waves autonomously
